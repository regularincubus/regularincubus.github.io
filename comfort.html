    <h1>Comfort</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose it was meant to happen eventually, although i didn&rsquo;t quite imagine our meeting to be so sudden, let alone so soon.&rdquo; she said, looking up at you from her desk. there was a steaming cup of tea next to her and you had to hold back a smile; heart racing and brain still foggy from it all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t know how exactly it happened. all you knew is that you closed your eyes, and when you next opened them, you stared into those familiar red crosses that, despite their caution and surprise, still managed to comfort you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your mouth opened, then closed again. and you had absolutely no clue as to what anyone would say in such a moment. luckily, however, arle was never lying to you when she said that she could still feel her other self; the connection was wavering, for sure, but this woman in front of you knew you were no threat. perhaps even knew so much more, but let&rsquo;s not assume too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;this situation is most unique, i must say. but please, sit down if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo; she said, pointing at the chair in front of her desk. it took you another few moments until you could think enough to move your legs. three steps, and you pulled the chair towards you; sitting down. it was cold, yet the material was still rather soft. certainly something of great quality; not that you expected something else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;would you like some tea?&rdquo; she asked you. &ldquo;i could have one of the children fetch one for you. perhaps some water, instead?&rdquo; she kept going. and yet, despite the racing thoughts in your head, your endless staring and the tremble in your hands, you did not respond. merely swallowed down the massive urge to just throw yourself into her arms and cry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were close with her. always. and yet, nothing ever felt closer than this; the warmth of the desk above your legs and her gaze looking at you. not statically like you're used to; but her eyes study you, taking in every move. observing, because at the end of the day, it seemed as if she, too, was acting on sheer gut feeling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shook your head and averted your gaze, playing with your fingers to distract yourself, keep yourself calm. &ldquo;no.&rdquo; you managed to rasp out. &ldquo;but thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she chuckled at that. it was angelic, if that even begins to explain it. soothing, and so uniquely her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her. in front of you. and it is more real than ever before; even though this was not your arle, but you felt that she is still more. that she still </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knows</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. you weren&rsquo;t sure what. but she just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;very well.&rdquo; she said and stood up, walked around the desk, perhaps trying to keep the control, and yet she looked like a cat pacing around its owners feet. you held back a smile once more, not wanting to anger her; and yet, the calm and warm affection you felt for her seethed deep within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;perhaps you could tell me about yourself.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i cannot be for sure, and yet, whatever this connection is, it transcends many of the possibilities known to me beforehand. you appearing seemingly out of nowhere only adds to my suspicions that you are the one thing i just cannot rid myself of. not that i am complaining of course; i am merely stating what i feel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you smiled. the sound of her voice, trying to analyze you. succeeding, too. her not knowing who exactly you are, when in a different universe, your universe, you make each other the happiest people on earth.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;surely you are.&rdquo; you say quietly, holding back tears at how directly she addresses you. obviously, you&rsquo;re having a very human conversation with her - between two people, who sit across from each other, or well, one person sitting down while the other paces around them; and you&rsquo;re just happy. despite the questions, despite the many uncertainties and the fact that this arle is not exactly your arle, you&rsquo;re happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m-&rdquo; you halt. how does one even start such a conversation? how could you tell the woman you love about you? when somewhere out there, this exact woman knows you better than you know yourself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa. my name is vanessa.&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;but you- i mean, most of my friends call me van.&rdquo; you add, the nervousness letting you share this rather useless detail. to everyone else, and for everyone else, this is almost trivial. yet to her; it&rsquo;s different. it&rsquo;s harder than you thought and just maybe this conversation is one of the hardest things you would ever do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; she repeated after you. she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;i think you know just who i am. after all, nothing about this decor, nor my appearance seems to faze, nor surprise you. which brings me to assume that you know me better than i would expect.&rdquo; she says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she sounds calm. but you know. of course you do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the way she stands, far more closed off than she ever did. her expression; the tension in her face and the quick, rather shallow breaths. you see her. and it makes you realize just how good you&rsquo;ve known her all along. just how well you can read her. and it scares you as much as it amazes you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you nod. &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;i know a thing or two about you. things you have not even shared with the children. depending on when we are.&rdquo; you add quietly, and of course you&rsquo;re met with a questioning gaze. more careful, too; although you know she does not see any danger within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but teyvat is a treacherous place. and you understand. you always would. always will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you look at her. &ldquo;who is the current hydro archon?&rdquo; you ask her simply. she exhales loudly. &ldquo;i am afraid that, after recent events, the title of hydro archon belongs to no one.&rdquo; she says. you nod in response, averting her gaze again. you look at all the paperwork in front of you; at the tea slowly cooling down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely now she won&rsquo;t drink it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although this thought did little to calm you down. since furina was not in charge of fontaine, this meant that the flood had already happened. which in return meant that, as of right now, project stuzha must be in preparation. and that made your stomach turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the silence felt suffocating. and the way she was tapping her arm with her fingers only made it worse. you could hear it, every movement of hers; and while you didn&rsquo;t know what exactly made your senses heighten so much, you could figure it was the crippling anxiety eating away every single fibre of your being. and it killed you. and knowing that whatever this was - an illusion, a dream, the last thing you&rsquo;ll see before you leave this world entirely - could end at any moment only made it worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t like wasting time. were afraid to do so. and if you did so now, you surely would hate yourself until the very day you&rsquo;d die.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so you looked at her again and took a deep breath; the tears at your eyes stinging, urging you to let them out. and yet, being the confidently direct you, there was one thing you could say to drown the silence, to earn her trust, to make her understand just how much you know her. how much you care, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i know about clervie.&rdquo; you state. her breath hitched just slightly; perfectly composed, but if this arle had one weakness, it was her past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;and how would you know?&rdquo; she asked in return. &ldquo;this was a matter in which only the members of the house of the hearth were involved, which makes me question just what role you play in all of this.&rdquo; she says, trying to keep her composure. you could feel it, could hear how that certain facade faltered just slightly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you feel satisfied to be able to make her feel that way. and it hurts because your arle has dropped that same facade entirely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m not talking about the occurrence at the house&rdquo; you add quietly. &ldquo;i could see it. somewhat, at least. how you killed crucabena. the withering lumidouce bell. your curse-&rdquo; you choked on held back tears as realization hits you. this is the first time you were so close to her curse, and there was next to nothing you could do about it. you couldn&rsquo;t caress it, stare at it for long. no matter how this conversation finds its end; it would still take ages for arle to open up like that. and that is, if you stayed here, which was just about as certain as clervie coming back to life.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;how do you know all of this?&rdquo; she asked, her voice broken and sweet. you knew you hit it, and you assumed that she must think you&rsquo;re some kind of bad spirit, a shadow haunting her, but worse than ever before. yet, you&rsquo;re not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&rsquo;re real. so is she.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a long story.&rdquo; you say. telling her the full truth, explaining to her just how you know all this; telling her about what exactly she is, what teyvat is and how it exists does not sound all too appealing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;essentially, however, somewhere along the way, a part of you ended up with me. in my universe, i mean. trapped in an object.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you know just how absurd that sounds. and maybe this sounds like something one of the children would tell her; one of the younger ones, whose fantasy is still untainted by the reality of it all. and yet, when you look at her again, you find nothing but those damn eyes, staring at the ground. her head was spinning, that much was clear. with what, you could only guess, but you also knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be in her stead right now.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;my consciousness has split, you say? and traversed the laws of this world, at least those obvious to us, to then find its way to you.&rdquo; she states and you can only nod. she walks back to her chair again and sits down. she looks at you, into your eyes, and you see softness. how you always envisioned your arle to look at you in such moments; how you saw her whenever you held the pillow close and closed your eyes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she swallows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it is true that i have been feeling a certain way for some time now.&rdquo; she starts. &ldquo;and yet, i could have never imagined this persisting emptiness to be caused through such a thing. it is a miracle, truly. especially now, that i had the pleasure of meeting you, i feel a sense of familiarity, yet i cannot exactly describe it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t need to. i am, you see-&nbsp; your other self and i are in a relationship.&rdquo; you state and are met with silence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;most interesting. for you and, well, me, i suppose, to share such a bond despite the hindrances.&rdquo; she says quietly. a deep inhale. you look at her, she exhales.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she seems spent. confused. even more tired than when she spent a night at a shore, gazing at the stars and the seas. she meets your gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you knew she had questions. but she wasn&rsquo;t stupid; well aware that your time here was limited. that you could disappear within the blink of an eye, and so she took the information and stored it. part of you already knew that it would stay at a place, where it would never be dug up ever again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&rsquo;re grateful. wouldn&rsquo;t want her reality to be all too different after all. and yet, the thought of it hurt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;do you know why you&rsquo;re here?&rdquo; she asks quietly. you nod, closing your eyes and letting a tear escape. it makes its way over your cheek, finding refuge at your jaw.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;in my world, i saw you. with your colleague. columbina.&rdquo; the name leaves a bitter taste in your mouth. &ldquo;and i could not take it anymore.&rdquo; you confess. and she nodded in return, because why would she ever confess if anything confuses her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she was so stupid. an idiot. here even more so than back at home. but you loved her nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;why is that?&rdquo; she asks. the concern in her voice is maddening. addicting. so is the softness, and yet the deep tone and -</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she was everything. will forever stay everything. and right now to had the chance to prove to her just how much you adore and worship and love her. and yet, not a single thing came out of your mouth. instead, you collected yourself quickly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;in my world, most people adore other peoples&rsquo; relationships. they root for them, wish for them, grieve and are happy with them. however, oftentimes they also want two people to be together and are rather&hellip; i&rsquo;ll be honest, they&rsquo;re annoying about it. constantly changing the personalities or even appearances to make people fit better.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the urge to say &lsquo;character&rsquo; is strong. luckily, arle doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;and with you it makes me-&rdquo; were you really going to be vulnerable with her? despite her and your arle being the same, some aspects still felt unfamiliar. and yet; &ldquo;it makes me furious. or sad. depends on the day. seeing you with columbina, it destroyed me internally.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;how come?&rdquo; she asked calmly and her cluelessness hurts you in ways you couldn&rsquo;t even think of prior to this meeting; prior to this unforeseen encounter that leaves your heart a throbbing mess. &ldquo;what kind of business between me and her could have you so upset?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you hated how calm she was, how warm she sounded; how she was so painfully like your arle. hated how it confirmed everything she has ever told you; that she was real.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and for a second, you wanted all this to stop. for it to be over, to break up with her and get it over with. but you knew you could never do it. she is your person after all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;would it sound somewhat reasonable when i tell you that you standing next to her gets to me?&rdquo; you say quietly, your voice beginning to strain from the emotions you kept hidden with expertise. &ldquo;i could see you smiling when you were with her. not genuinely, but the smile of this facade you use when talking on diplomatic terms-&rdquo; and you just realized how straight up weird all of that must sound. and yet, there was not an ounce of judgement in her gaze. &ldquo;-but what the people make of it, i; it destroys me.&rdquo; you confess.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;they assume all kinds of things. where i&rsquo;m from, you and her are both versions of some old theatric play. and in said play, your characters are in a relationship. you both are so popular amongst the masses, it sickens me. everyone accepts it, no one questions it, and one wrong word from either of you and everyone goes crazy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">if being like this could get you answers out of her, then you would gladly lose your dignity, your composure and just about anything else. for her, her alone and always her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;the game you played? in which you scared one another by sneaking up behind the others&rsquo; back? i have seen so many romantic things about that. and every single time i wanted to carve my eyeballs out, discard you and just cry for hours. even kill myself, if it ever got too severe.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing ever broke you. you have survived far more than most humans and struggled with the aftermath still. and yet, nothing has ever made you as painfully angry as your arle being shipped with columbina. and that you hated the latter for that was also an odd thought. you knew your fair share, so it might be a little unfair to hate her.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but how could you not? if everyone projected their stupidly sick fantasies onto both of them; if everyone acted like they had kissed on screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">they did not even talk just yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">did not have flirty moments, did not have their own short film, nothing. it was just the play and nostalgia that kept the people. and how arle was portrayed; tall, muscular, utterly handsome and the perfect husband.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you feld like throwing up. seeing her in front of you, in flesh and blood; how could this be a&nbsp; perfect husband? when she was </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">your</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> perfect </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">wife</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> already?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;so please, arlecchino,&rdquo; even that name feels slightly sour in your mouth right now; your thoughts racing with all those delusional people. &ldquo;please tell me there is nothing between you both. please.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course you&rsquo;re met with silence. and yet, quicker than anticipated, the click of her heels brings you back to life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">suddenly, she stands before you. you look up at her, and under any normal circumstance, your gaze would have lingered on her for some more time. and yet, when you felt a singular finger of hers at your chin, lifting your head up, your heart skipped two beats before stopping entirely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i cannot name that feeling exactly, yet the thought of you has never failed to not amaze me. i do not know what my other self and you share. and though i find myself quite curious indeed, i don&rsquo;t know if i truly wish to know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her hand withdraws again and you feel like an abandoned kitten.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;but i can assure you that the sentiment those people see in her and me, is nothing more than a mere exaggeration of things as they are.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the sound of her voice was warm. wrapped around you like a blanket, and for the first time in weeks, you felt safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you know about clervie. so you probably know about the bond we shared. and that is all there is to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her voice broke, her eyes dimmed. seeing her being hurt makes you as happy as it concerns you; the sheer want to pull her in and comfort her, finally really embracing her like you had planned for so long is slowly taking over our very soul. and yet you stayed silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;so, vanessa, i can reassure you that between her and me is merely a collegial relationship. and, admittedly, with her leaving the ranks of the fatui, even that denotation proves to be incorrect.&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you stared at her. your heart didn&rsquo;t feel lighter, realizing this was nowhere close to being enough. you needed her, in all the ways. needed to pull her in, bury your face in her chest, feeling the warmth of her body against yours. you needed to touch her, to kiss her; needed to fuck her and stay connected for all eternity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, all you could manage to do is speak.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;arle-&rdquo; you tried not to care about the nickname slipping out. &ldquo;your other self, she told me something. something so silly, it will ruin this moment for sure.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh?&rdquo; she said, her eyes hardening again just slightly. &ldquo;do tell.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you took a deep breath. cursed yourself for what you were about to say.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you were 13. there was a cucumber involved. need i say more?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her eyes widen and her mouth turn to open, before she ultimately composes herself and goes back to her strict demeanour again. however, she does not speak. not a single word. merely stared ad you, clearly considering and planning her next move. and yet, she felt it too. this connection, this trust, maybe even this love. she felt it deeply, so there was no denying.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose not. and i must say, i admire the trust between me and you.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i obviously haven&rsquo;t told anyone about this, so, for you to know such a secret is a little unexpected. though not unpleasant.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you stare at her, a huge smile starting to form. this was basically all the confirmation you needed and honestly? this was so much more than you could have ever wished for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and with the new confirmation, you decide to do something. you looked down, at her hands, and at the way she hugged her own body with them. you wanted to touch them. not hold them - well, maybe that too - but touch them. the final step to reassure that all of this, whatever this is, is real.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, when you reached out, watched her eyes widen just slightly; she was gone, within the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">darkness engulfed you. this feeling in your heart, heavy and throbbing. it was painful this time, beyond anything you have ever felt. but at the same time, there was a lightness to it; as if something within you had finally clicked, after all this time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you opened your eyes and found yourself in your bed, your arle resting comfortably in your arms. you noticed a few wet spots on her, felt the same wetness on your cheek, too.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you will ask her about this later. if she felt it, if she was there and if she even knew what was up in the first place. but for now, you will sleep some more. it&rsquo;s still early, the sun appears to have barely risen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you turn around, trying to get comfortable again, realization hits you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you met arle. the real arle. your arle, or rather the part of her that has been missing for so long. a wave of joy overcomes you; so much, that you don&rsquo;t even process her words about a certain other harbinger. that will follow in the morning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for now, you close your eyes. you feel. the blanket around your body, maulis arm in your hand, your arle in your arms.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and if you focus enough, you feel another hand; holding yours tight, granting you your wish.</span></p>
