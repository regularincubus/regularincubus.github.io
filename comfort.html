    <h1>Comfort</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose it was meant to happen eventually, although i didn&rsquo;t quite imagine our meeting to be so sudden, let alone so soon.&rdquo; she said, looking up at you from her desk. there was a steaming cup of tea next to her and you had to hold back a smile; heart racing and brain still foggy from it all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t know how exactly it happened. all you knew is that you closed your eyes, and when you next opened them, you stared into those familiar red crosses that, despite their caution and surprise, still managed to comfort you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your mouth opened, then closed again. and you had absolutely no clue as to what anyone would say in such a moment. luckily, however, arle was never lying to you when she said that she could still feel her other self; the connection was wavering, for sure, but this woman in front of you knew you were no threat. perhaps even knew so much more, but let&rsquo;s not assume too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;this situation is most unique, i must say. but please, sit down if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo; she said, pointing at the chair in front of her desk. it took you another few moments until you could think enough to move your legs. three steps, and you pulled the chair towards you; sitting down. it was cold, yet the material was still rather soft. certainly something of great quality; not that you expected something else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;would you like some tea?&rdquo; she asked you. &ldquo;i could have one of the children fetch one for you. perhaps some water, instead?&rdquo; she kept going. and yet, despite the racing thoughts in your head, your endless staring and the tremble in your hands, you did not respond. merely swallowed down the massive urge to just throw yourself into her arms and cry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were close with her. always. and yet, nothing ever felt closer than this; the warmth of the desk above your legs and her gaze looking at you. not statically like you're used to; but her eyes study you, taking in every move. observing, because at the end of the day, it seemed as if she, too, was acting on sheer gut feeling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shook your head and averted your gaze, playing with your fingers to distract yourself, keep yourself calm. &ldquo;no.&rdquo; you managed to rasp out. &ldquo;but thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she chuckled at that. it was angelic, if that even begins to explain it. soothing, and so uniquely her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her. in front of you. and it is more real than ever before; even though this was not your arle, but you felt that she is still more. that she still </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knows</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. you weren&rsquo;t sure what. but she just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;very well.&rdquo; she said and stood up, walked around the desk, perhaps trying to keep the control, and yet she looked like a cat pacing around its owners feet. you held back a smile once more, not wanting to anger her; and yet, the calm and warm affection you felt for her seethed deep within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;perhaps you could tell me about yourself.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i cannot be for sure, and yet, whatever this connection is, it transcends many of the possibilities known to me beforehand. you appearing seemingly out of nowhere only adds to my suspicions that you are the one thing i just cannot rid myself from. not that i am complaining of course; i am merely stating what i feel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you smiled. the sound of her voice, trying to analyze you. succeeding, too. her not knowing who exactly you are, when in a different universe, your universe, you make each other the happiest people on earth.</span></p>
