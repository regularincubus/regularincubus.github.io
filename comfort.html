    <h1>Comfort</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose it was meant to happen eventually, although i didn&rsquo;t quite imagine our meeting to be so sudden, let alone so soon.&rdquo; she said, looking up at you from her desk. there was a steaming cup of tea next to her and you had to hold back a smile; heart racing and brain still foggy from it all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t know how exactly it happened. all you knew is that you closed your eyes, and when you next opened them, you stared into those familiar red crosses that, despite their caution and surprise, still managed to comfort you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your mouth opened, then closed again. and you had absolutely no clue as to what anyone would say in such a moment. luckily, however, arle was never lying to you when she said that she could still feel her other self; the connection was wavering, for sure, but this woman in front of you knew you were no threat. perhaps even knew so much more, but let&rsquo;s not assume too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;this situation is most unique, i must say. but please, sit down if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo; she said, pointing at the chair in front of her desk. it took you another few moments until you could think enough to move your legs. three steps, and you pulled the chair towards you; sitting down. it was cold, yet the material was still rather soft. certainly something of great quality; not that you expected something else.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;would you like some tea?&rdquo; she asked you. &ldquo;i could have one of the children fetch one for you. perhaps some water, instead?&rdquo; she kept going. and yet, despite the racing thoughts in your head, your endless staring and the tremble in your hands, you did not respond. merely swallowed down the massive urge to just throw yourself into her arms and cry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were close with her. always. and yet, nothing ever felt closer than this; the warmth of the desk above your legs and her gaze looking at you. not statically like you're used to; but her eyes study you, taking in every move. observing, because at the end of the day, it seemed as if she, too, was acting on sheer gut feeling.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shook your head and averted your gaze, playing with your fingers to distract yourself, keep yourself calm. &ldquo;no.&rdquo; you managed to rasp out. &ldquo;but thank you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she chuckled at that. it was angelic, if that even begins to explain it. soothing, and so uniquely her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her. in front of you. and it is more real than ever before; even though this was not your arle, but you felt that she is still more. that she still </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knows</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. you weren&rsquo;t sure what. but she just </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">knew</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;very well.&rdquo; she said and stood up, walked around the desk, perhaps trying to keep the control, and yet she looked like a cat pacing around its owners feet. you held back a smile once more, not wanting to anger her; and yet, the calm and warm affection you felt for her seethed deep within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;perhaps you could tell me about yourself.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i cannot be for sure, and yet, whatever this connection is, it transcends many of the possibilities known to me beforehand. you appearing seemingly out of nowhere only adds to my suspicions that you are the one thing i just cannot rid myself of. not that i am complaining of course; i am merely stating what i feel.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you smiled. the sound of her voice, trying to analyze you. succeeding, too. her not knowing who exactly you are, when in a different universe, your universe, you make each other the happiest people on earth.</span></p>
<p><br /><br /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;surely you are.&rdquo; you say quietly, holding back tears at how directly she addresses you. obviously, you&rsquo;re having a very human conversation with her - between two people, who sit across from each other, or well, one person sitting down while the other paces around them; and you&rsquo;re just happy. despite the questions, despite the many uncertainties and the fact that this arle is not exactly your arle, you&rsquo;re happy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m-&rdquo; you halt. how does one even start such a conversation? how could you tell the woman you love about you? when somewhere out there, this exact woman knows you better than you know yourself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa. my name is vanessa.&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;but you- i mean, most of my friends call me van.&rdquo; you add, the nervousness letting you share this rather useless detail. to everyone else, and for everyone else, this is almost trivial. yet to her; it&rsquo;s different. it&rsquo;s harder than you thought and just maybe this conversation is one of the hardest things you would ever do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; she repeated after you. she closed her eyes and took a deep breath. &ldquo;i think you know just who i am. after all, nothing about this decor, nor my appearance seems to faze, nor surprise you. which brings me to assume that you know me better than i would expect.&rdquo; she says.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she sounds calm. but you know. of course you do.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the way she stands, far more closed off than she ever did. her expression; the tension in her face and the quick, rather shallow breaths. you see her. and it makes you realize just how good you&rsquo;ve known her all along. just how well you can read her. and it scares you as much as it amazes you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you nod. &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; you whisper. &ldquo;i know a thing or two about you. things you have not even shared with the children. depending on when we are.&rdquo; you add quietly, and of course you&rsquo;re met with a questioning gaze. more careful, too; although you know she does not see any danger within.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but teyvat is a treacherous place. and you understand. you always would. always will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you look at her. &ldquo;who is the current hydro archon?&rdquo; you ask her simply. she exhales loudly. &ldquo;i am afraid that, after recent events, the title of hydro archon belongs to no one.&rdquo; she says. you nod in response, averting her gaze again. you look at all the paperwork in front of you; at the tea slowly cooling down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely now she won&rsquo;t drink it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although this thought did little to calm you down. since furina was not in charge of fontaine, this meant that the flood had already happened. which in return meant that, as of right now, project stuzha must be in preparation. and that made your stomach turn.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the silence felt suffocating. and the way she was tapping her arm with her fingers only made it worse. you could hear it, every movement of hers; and while you didn&rsquo;t know what exactly made your senses heighten so much, you could figure it was the crippling anxiety eating away every single fibre of your being. and it killed you. and knowing that whatever this was - an illusion, a dream, the last thing you&rsquo;ll see before you leave this world entirely - could end at any moment only made it worse.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t like wasting time. were afraid to do so. and if you did so now, you surely would hate yourself until the very day you&rsquo;d die.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so you looked at her again and took a deep breath; the tears at your eyes stinging, urging you to let them out. and yet, being the confidently direct you, there was one thing you could say to drown the silence, to earn her trust, to make her understand just how much you know her. how much you care, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i know about clervie.&rdquo; you state. her breath hitched just slightly; perfectly compose, but if this arle had one weakness, it was her past.</span></p>
