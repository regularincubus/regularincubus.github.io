    <div class="story-content">
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa had always burned for answers. It was not the kind of hunger that could be sated by books or whispered tales; it was a fire that crackled behind their eyes, a restless flame that refused to die down until the truth was in hand.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so, every single thing they overheard, every gossip from the sailors ashore, every tale of heroes from elderly ladies in the nearby cafe, got double checked, filed away in the endless storage they called their mind.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One night, after being tasked to find out about their heritage, as per the demand of none other than Arlecchino, the Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers, they not only got stuck on a particularly difficult chapter of an old Khaenri&rsquo;ahn book, but they also found themselves frustrated at the sheer drought of new information all those files provided</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They had raided the entire library of Mondstadt, much to the librarians dismay, and yet, all they found was the same information they had read about in books from Sumeru, Liyue, even Inazuma. It seemed pointless, and while it was not necessarily demotivating, it was a challenge to keep going with the same relentless vigor.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They were determined, of course, but they were also just a mentally exhausted being like many others.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pouring themselves a glass of lemonade, the new favorite beverage of the Harbinger, they gave themselves the rare opportunity to get lost in thought. For once, not about themselves, but the woman they grew to adore.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How despite the rather unpredictable demeanour, a rather kind soul seemingly slumbered underneath the facade.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For others, it must be difficult to say where the mask ended and the woman began.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But Vanessa wanted to know.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why? That answer, too, was a mystery. A mystery they had yet to uncover.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was not the kind of woman one should admire. Especially most commonfolk kept their distance from her.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vanessa knew that. And yet...</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each fact learned, each myth disproven, each hidden truth uncovered about her not only brought answers, but all the more questions&mdash;and a deepening warmth.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And sometimes they asked themselves:</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did it hurt to look at her that way?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And why, in the stillness after every discovery, did Vanessa catch themselves thinking not of the next clue&mdash;but of Arlecchino's voice, her resilience, her unreadable gaze and the soft clicks and clanks of her shoes?</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the scholar had become the studied.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to get that thought of their mind, they shook their head. Standing in the bar, late at night while figuring out their growing sentiment will get them nowhere.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, when they wanted to finish the last bits of their drink, a rather heavy object touched their lips.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost too big for the glass, they tried to remove the shining vision that appeared within. Following moments of disbelief, lots of questions, and yet acceptance, they rinsed it off with water and let it dry next to them.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was something to deal with later. And perhaps one day, they would find out why the gods bestowed them with this favor. But for now, the research for Arlecchino continues. All for the sheer purpose of bringing her clarity, of course.</span></p>
        <p><strong><br /></strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&rsquo;s not what they say. Not entirely. I&rsquo;ve seen... shadows in her fire. And maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;I want to stand close enough to feel them.</span></em></p>
