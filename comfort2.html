    <h1>Comfort Two </h1>
    <p>a few days have passed since you saw her. to say you haven&rsquo;t been the same, would be an understatement.</p>
    <p>day and night were spent thinking about the incident, about her words. unfortunately, real life hadn&rsquo;t been all too kind either - social media, most importantly arle&rsquo;s popularity and the bubble surrounding her, drove you crazy. of course, you could easily distance yourself, and you did, but it followed you everywhere, onto every single timeline, into real life, into your dreams.</p>
    <p>although today, you found yourself in a different scenery. last time, it was her office, or so you suspected, and the few nightmares after that it was always a different place. a forest here, your old classroom there, your own apartment was next.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and yet, standing in those massive halls, you looked through a window and saw a beautiful area in front of you, all green, vibrant grass, a small pond and some trees. yet, behind this seemingly idyllic place, there was this wall. it wasn&rsquo;t all too high, not like the ones you had seen in attack on titan, or fontaine, but they were still way too high up to climb, no matter if child or adult.</p>
    <p>you step away from the window. this place seems familiar, although you know every place in teyvat, and it was teyvat, no doubt. and yet, something told you that this was not new.</p>
    <p>you turned away from the window, turned around. there was a room with a desk, some chairs. as you stepped closer, a shelf, a cupboard. and only as your gaze drifted across the room again, did you finally see it.</p>
    <p>a big, beautiful chocolate cake.</p>
    <p>your heart stopped, and you immediately knew where you were. despite your urges to run away, force yourself to wake up, you didn&rsquo;t. whatever this was, it must have been something, right? something new, something your mind, the world, the universe, has deemed you worthy to experience. and who were you to deny fate? at least in that case, that is.</p>
    <p>you stepped closer, approached the cake. it looked delicious, and the image of <em>her</em> standing there, in the corner, looking like someone forgot her somewhere, made you smile more than anyone or anything else ever could. it was not fair. and suddenly, all the pain you felt for a past that wasn&rsquo;t yours resurfaced.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>her, sacrificing her life, seemingly giving up her old life and name, only to keep <em>her</em> locked away, far from where anyone could reach her. it was beyond you how she allowed someone like you, a nobody in your declining eyes, so deep into her heart. but you were not complaining at the end of the day. it just made your heart fill with sorrow and yearning alike.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;oh, you&rsquo;re here already?&rdquo; you heard a voice. it was squeaky, high, childish, and it came from behind you. you knew whose voice it was. it made your heart stop, your blood freeze, shivers of anxiety running down your spine. reflexively, you dig your nails into your palm as you clench your fists, and do not dare to turn around.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no, don&rsquo;t be scared&rdquo; she chuckled and walked towards you, small steps in little shoes steady on the ground. &ldquo;perrie told me about you!&rdquo; she said.</p>
    <p>you stared at the cake, didn&rsquo;t follow it as she pulled it towards her; you didn&rsquo;t dare to watch as she slowly cut herself a piece.</p>
    <p>stuck in place, the cake came back to your field of view. you heard her chew ever so slightly, the clanking of a fork against a plate made your head spin.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you can take some, we have more than enough,&rdquo; she said, mouth stuffed, and the way she said it made you dizzy.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no, but thank you&rdquo; you said quietly, your throat hurting from unspilled tears. your nails dig deeper.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;well, if you want some, you can always take some.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you could hear the smile in her voice and the clanking of the fork continued, and for some reason it was the most painful sound you heard in a while.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; you said, repeating yourself. how would you even start a conversation like this? this was beyond anything you had ever prepared yourself for, and something you never even wanted to happen necessarily.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t know you, but perrie does. at least i think so. have you met before? she keeps on talking about feeling a pull to somewhere, but doesn&rsquo;t know where to exactly.&rdquo; in this moment, you wondered which arle she was referring to - how young or old she was. if she stood in direct correlation to the situation you found yourself in last time. it was confusing. it didn&rsquo;t add up. &ldquo;it worried me a little.&rdquo; but you knew how little time you had. that all of this could be over within the blink of an eye.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;what did she tell you about me?&rdquo; you asked straight away.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;hm, let me think.&rdquo; she said and put her plate on the cupboard next to her. &ldquo;she said that there is someone out there who feels deeply for her. and that, i quote, &lsquo;despite the extraordinary circumstances, i feel the same&rsquo;. at least something along those lines.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you chuckled. the deep voice, the way she quoted her - for some reason clervie was able to talk to adult arle. how exactly was a mystery to you. &ldquo;what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; you said and turned around. there she sat, on a small chair, her cake abandoned next to her. she was beautiful, with the lumidouce bell hanging around her neck, and looked just like you know her. not a single thing about her was different, and the tears behind your eyes returned with a stinging pain, and yet, you held them back.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;vanessa,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;a beautiful name! i&rsquo;m sure you know me, but just to make sure. i&rsquo;m clervie.&rdquo; she said and you nodded, walked a step towards her. &ldquo;i know. hello, clervie.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you kept on walking and knelt down in front of her, meeting her eye-to-eye.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;which perrie did you talk to?&rdquo; you asked quietly. clervie chuckled. &ldquo;what do you mean? perrie! or do you know her as the knave now, too?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you forced a smile, nodded again. not feeling capable of doing much more. this was more challenging than most things in your entire life; it felt as if you were invading a space that wasn&rsquo;t yours to tread upon.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i see. well, she is the knave now. so, i talked to her grown-up self. and you did the same, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i did.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s good. i hope she could tell you everything she told me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you avert your gaze from her. &ldquo;well, when i last met her, i explained to her how we are in a relationship. but, somewhere else. and that that feeling she feels is directed at me, but that it&rsquo;s complicated and just- urgh, forgive me. this sounds incredibly messy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>in response, clervie simply shrugged.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i may not know how exactly all of this works, but i know one thing for sure: as far as i know perrie, i can see that you are super important to her!&rdquo; she said, sitting on the chair with a big smile on her face. her legs were dangling away, she seemed so carefree, just like you had seen and remembered her young self. it was beautiful, although a deep mourning flooded through your chest at the thought of what would happen to her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;but may i ask you something? because there is still something i don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo; she asked and you nodded, still looking into her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;how come you know so much? is it because you are from somewhere else?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you nod again. &ldquo;yes. you see, where i am from, a part of perrie is still with me. so, she can explain some things to me&rdquo; you said, and clervie&rsquo;s eyes widened. &ldquo;oh, i think i understand! so you have your own perrie? but wait, this perrie is part of my perrie too, isn&rsquo;t she? that&rsquo;s confusing.&rdquo; and you chuckle at that. wouldn&rsquo;t it be confusing to everyone who wasn&rsquo;t directly involved?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;but i love her regardless. your perrie and my perrie alike.&rdquo; you said, plainly. and her expression changed from a hint of disappointment at her own inability to understand, to something you could only ever see in all kinds of artworks. she looked smug, with a smile that knew what you were talking about. your own smile can&rsquo;t help but follow hers quickly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;so she found someone she can love?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes growing soft. &ldquo;and you love her too?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;yes. that&rsquo;s what happened.&rdquo; you said with a nod. <em>and i love you, too, in my own way. you are important to me, too, and i would never see a rival in you</em>, you desperately wanted to say, but something kept you from it. the topics of your conversation with arle last time havent been mentioned once, and you would rather not bring them up now. not when you could just talk to clervie herself.</p>
    <p>she lets out a deep breath and leans against the chair she is sitting in. &ldquo;i&rsquo;m glad. seeing who she grew up to be, it makes me very happy.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>a painful reminder of the reality of all this, of how things will turn out to be. that the words, the way she talks, all of this is a construct of your own imagination. but just like with arle back then, there must be some truth and reality to it all. there can&rsquo;t be any other way-</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m happy she found you. however messy it might be for now. i hope she is able to reach you one day. you deserve it, both of you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>she looked at you, leaning forward and putting a small hand on your shoulder. &ldquo;perrie is strong. i do think she will reach you and be with you. she succeeded in everything she ever put her mind on. i don&rsquo;t think that will stop.&rdquo; she smiled at you, brightly. and just like how you witnessed it so long ago, you see that she is slowly beginning to dissolve, the course of nature taking its turn and taking her away from you, too, as the sunlight slowly entered the room through the very window you first saw when you appeared here. you look at her, trying to memorize every single feature, trying to engrave her into your mind because she deserves no less.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo; she said and smiled at you. &ldquo;perrie will protect you, just how she wanted to with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>your heart felt tight, and you wondered if this was arle&rsquo;s pain you felt, or your own; if it was both or if one prevailed.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;take care of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>and you hated how similar it all was. how your brain wired it all together, and how real it still felt. &ldquo;and take care of perrie, too!&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you swallowed down your tears as you kept on looking at her, nodding slightly, hoping she would see it. and she did, of course she did.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i hope we meet again one day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense. as the last bits of her disappeared, and you finally succumbed to the weight in your chest and let yourself slump down on the ground, you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what that last sentence was supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>was that clervie speaking?</p>
    <p>was that a mixture of your own thoughts and arle&rsquo;s feelings?</p>
    <p>or was it something random your brain threw together all along.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you closed your eyes and as you opened them again, you were in your bed. just like last time. again, teardrops stained your pillow, stained arle. but unlike last time, there was no lightness to it all. just this heavy weight of losing someone all over again. you nuzzled into arle, as you felt something on your cheek you hadn&rsquo;t noticed earlier.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the long ear of a certain coral-coloured plushie is stopping another tear from coming out.</p>
