    <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&rsquo;ve never felt more relieved after closing the bar for good tonight. it&rsquo;s two in the morning, fairly early for all the guests to leave already - but then again, the weekend had yet to come, and given the upcoming weinlesefest, things would only get so much more heated as time passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, diona and master diluc had way more business, residing in mondstadt directly. every visitor and tourist from afar, as well as the residents, preferred the city over good old dornman port - much so because the festivities were brighter, more colorful and cheerful there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which is, to be frank, the exact reason you stayed away from it. despite being a symbol for tourism, a symbol for all things celebratory, show and vacation, dornman port grew quiet after a certain time each evening. when the laughter from the street faded away, the wind carried it to hotels, bars, houses and sometimes even the beach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and even that stopped after some time. most of the time, around midnight, most of the nightlife came to a slow and steady halt. going home, sleeping through the dizzy haze of sweet cider and strong whiskey, always sounded the most appealing, especially when the prices went up after midnight. naturally, an expensive beverage imported from fontaine could cost double during such nights, yet it did wonders to properly tame the drunkards quickly withdrawing their last order before stumbling out of the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as you make your way home, you look around. many small houses, lots of them being rented out on a regular basis. you knew all of them by heart, been inside most of them too. a childhood growing up in a hotspot of travel certainly had its charm when many different friends constantly invited you over to see their holiday homes. delightful memories, even if a little unimaginable nowadays.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite gaining the charismatic nature from your father, just like your passion for barkeeping, you prefer to keep to yourself. openness came naturally to you, yet barely any customer was able to get behind the first name basis. not that you cared much; at the end of the day, most of them left, anyway. you were merely here to give them a good time while it lasted, and that never included you revealing all too much about yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you once told kaeya about your past crushes, about how this one girl broke your heart. he was sympathetic about it, though he, too, kept his fair amount of distance still. that was alright, very much so. you didn&rsquo;t need a hug then, and he just so happened to understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">later that week he asked you if you&rsquo;re interested in meeting someone, he could potentially set you up. you kindly declined, but gave him 50% off his next order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to your right, there was a small cafe. it was barely open nowadays, despite customers yearning for its coffee and ice cream. yet, the owner got older, more forgetful. some locals suggested his son to take over, yet he didn&rsquo;t want to even think about helping out his old man like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you sighed, knowing that at some point, all the people you&rsquo;ve grown up with - young and old (mostly old, though; your best friends mostly consisted of people eight or nine times your age when you yourself were little) will simply die and be forgotten eventually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you never cared much about this; have been preparing for the worst for as long as you can remember - your grandmother, your grandfather, mom and dad. it&rsquo;ll be okay when they pass, and it&rsquo;ll be okay when you do, too. it&rsquo;s not like you plan on staying long, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">quietly you walk on your grandmother&rsquo;s plot, careful not to wake the neighbours. quietly, you unlock the door and walk inside; taking off your shoes, using the bathroom, changing. it&rsquo;s a set routine, one you have grown accustomed to, and one you enjoy nonetheless.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you finish up quickly, not wanting to brush your teeth in the first place turned into a normal length session thankfully. you always took great care of that, always took care of yourself as diligently as you could. and when you finally went to bed and closed your eyes, something unexpected happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">that night, you dreamt of the woman in the bar - the fatua with the superficial smile. how she drank her wine, her subordinates - no - her </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">children&rsquo;s</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> eyes trained on her, watching every move.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you didn&rsquo;t know her name, obviously. what should be the occasion? you get asked for your name every single day, and only rarely do you receive something other than an extra tip in return. and yet, you never really cared about any of them, and were honestly glad when some selected ones left, and the fact that she stayed on your mind shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising either. her arms, her eyes, her entire demeanour. it was enchanting, of sorts; captivating at last. and something about her just couldn&rsquo;t leave your mind. like a connection, like this encounter was not nearly as accidental and casual as it should have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, she was gone. travelers rarely stayed in one place for too long, and only scarcely have you seen the same fatui enter the establishment twice. it just wasn&rsquo;t like that and maybe it was better like this, anway. yearning for a person now was not part of your plans, much less someone potentially dangerous. you heard stories, from across the nations. about a fair lady stealing the anemo archon&rsquo;s - your archon&rsquo;s - gnosis. about fatui wreaking havoc in liyue. the delusions in inazuma. and ever so briefly, you heard stories about a girl in sumeru having been victim to the doctor&rsquo;s experiments. you didn&rsquo;t know if that was true or not, rumors can be over the top sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">still, you did not want to risk it. whoever this woman was, she was someone of high status. thankfully, you treated her the same. so tere was really no reason to be afraid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">holding the hand of your childhood teddy bear, you turned around. taking a deep breath, you closed your eyes, playing with the broken arm of your most comfortable companion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the night is surprisingly short. not much sleep, but not many complaints either. your pain was manageable today, and the breakfast your grandmother prepared for you was delicious. tomorrow you would be travelling back to mondstadt for the weekend, so your shift today is earlier than anticipated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">kissing your grandfather good morning as you eat your food, drinking just the tiniest bits of water afterwards - you wouldn&rsquo;t want to overdo it after all. too much hydration would be scandalous for someone who survived their entire life off of a small bottle every two days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you relax that morning, spending your time packing your stuff for the trip. you managed to buy a small plushie for diona a few weeks ago. a merchant from sumeru sold it and it was rumored to have resemblance to an old saurian who once lived in natlan, but developed into another type of reptile nowadays. the merchant was lively, extroverted to no end. she really did try to sell her stuff, though her methods were a little&hellip; extreme sometimes. the sailors who sold their good share of things were never this pushy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">aside from the woman yesterday, there was another strange occurrence: you remember feeling a shiver running down your arms when you bought the plushie. it was a warm day, and there was no wind. and yet, shortly after you wanted to leave the makeshift store of the merchant girl, something cold crawled down your entire body. you felt dizzy for a second. to this day, you wonder what that was.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps your health was acting up again, who knows. you certainly would not be surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">placing your bag next to the door, you put on your shoes and bid farewell to your grandparents. you love them, and staying with them is beautiful. but you&rsquo;re excited nonetheless to see your mom again, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you leave the house and make your way to work. your shift will end at noon, and then you&rsquo;ll catch the next carriage to mondstadt. travelling at night is dangerous, but more convenient. besides, eula and the others should be on patrol, so that makes it safer, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">on your way to the bar, you think about your to-do list. what needs to be done, how you will arrange the freshly cleaned cups, which will earn you a compliment from the owner and a sigh from the soul taking on the shift afterwards. barely anyone can keep up with your cleanliness and sense of order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don&rsquo;t see the fatui operatives in the distance as you open up the bar, ready for service; nor do you realize that the woman from yesterday has been sipping scalding hot tea in a cafe right across the street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you do, however, notice when the door opens, presenting your first customer of the day.</span></p>
