    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
      <p>
         your hands smell faintly of juniper, citrus and a hint of sunsettia puree. a barkeeper’s tend to do so — sweet deliciousness lifting the spirits around you, yet that same smell is stained with the memory of half-drunk glasses and customers who never quite know when to leave. their groans and cries echo in your ear every evening, and you wish you could have the same ear piece like the akademiya’s scribe. from what you know, he was a calm presence. and you had no doubt the silence he surrounded himself with was part of it all.
         you’ve never been in sumeru, never really left mondstadt for all it’s worth. if anything, the most you traveled was the commute between dornman port and the city of mondstadt. not that you were complaining - solitude and peace were much preferred over the troublesome and bustling life of those from the adventurer’s guild. you didn’t envy them, yet sometimes you couldn’t help but worry about bennett and his friends. the scars and wounds they carry around surely stem from long, hard-won battles. you once mixed a concoction per barbara’S request. she herself had been busy that day - a long expedition, leaving plenty harmed and at barbatos’ mercy. and you were one of the few people she would trust with something like this- measuring out the correct amounts to the last digit on the scale. she thanked you with some of her spicy energy drinks. you don’t drink them, but mix some in the drinks of those, who should have long left, but unnecessarily push their limits and other people’s comfort zones. 
         no one had been aware of your little trick just yet, despite everyone knowing you by heart. your finesse, your demeanour, your efficiency; yes, you truly made both the angel’s share and the cat’s tail look like cheap establishments on your best nights. multiple orders in a row, and when the waiters and waitresses already practiced their resignation speech, you pushed through, serving customer after customer, drunkard over drunkard with practiced ears open enough for the dockworkers to trust you, and long enough for the sailors to spill even the nastiest of secrets.
         you pour their wine. you mix their rum. you listen to their foolish boasts, their tired confessions, their half-sung sea shanties that never reach the right key. and you like it, truly; stepping into your father’s footsteps has never felt more right.
         your anxieties, the usual ones that kept on nagging on you, eating away every ounce of safety you have created for yourself; they were at bay, whenever the shaker was in your hand, when you could feel the weight of dandelion wine, some mint, three ice cubes and a splash of sweet flower in your hand. 
         it was your signature drink tonight; one many had anticipated. diona and you were awake for ages that night, the bar in the cats tail a certified mess as the feline girl munched on some canned sardines.
         “i don’t even know why you would want it to taste good. i’d always show these drunkards how disgusting this brew is!” she exclaimed, laying on the couch. she rested her legs against the backrest, her hand dangling free above the ground. it was then when you realized how young she truly was, and you smiled to yourself, as you added the last leaf of mint to the shaker.
         it was always the same. repetitive work, always working the closing shift since that's all your sleep schedule allowed. you wouldn’t want it any other way; no, you came to love this routine, the people, the regulars. chatting and occasionally downing a shot in one go, impressing the old fellas, who did not think that someone as young as you could take it.
         you listen and you observe; and somewhere in between their stories, you polish the counter and used glasses until they gleam like the morning sun on cider lake.
         it is always the same. and you couldn’t complain, even if you tried.
         yet, despite the monotonous routine of a rising barkeeping genius, even you could not escape the cold breeze coming in, as two fatui operatives opened the door. you ignored them, while everyone else started watching and staring as if seeing something alien; as if barbatos himself came back in person. you could hear the whispers; the hissing and muttering. some were rude, some were disrespectful, while others began to tremble in fear.
         honestly, you didn’t understand either. so far, any activity from the fatui in mondstadt was very much not like in the other nations. they mostly stayed at goth hotel anyway, and except for sometimes occupying sara due to a seemingly shared break at midday, there is nothing you could complain about. they were friendly, despite their status - not that you would openly defend them; else someone might as well send the knights of favonius on your neck.
         the tavern doors groan open against the salt-stained wood, agonizingly slow. the faint scent of sea spray, the bite of autumn chill; a hint of smoke from some distant ship. an all too familiar mixture of the beauty of dornman port. candles flicker. one of them gutters out completely, and you raise a brow at just how long the two women would hold the door open. any longer and you might need to tell them to tune it down. great.
         however, it isn’t before long when a long, slender figure enters the establishment.
         for a moment, no one turns, all eyes set on the door and the person walks slowly; her heels clicking on the ground in a shrill, piercing tone. you don’t look - knowing what fuss the others made, you had no interest in making a customer feel uncomfortable.
         they don’t rush, their steps measured, deliberate. like someone who belongs in every space they enter, whether welcomed or not. someone mutters fatui. not loud, but enough for you to hear. the word drifts like a cold draft through the room, and you try to ignore the ringing in your ears.
         you felt a chair shift at the bar; heard the faint sound of fabric on the cheap lather as someone sat down behind you. you finished cleaning the glass you had been working on and turned around in a swift motion, the air being knocked right out of your lungs as you saw her.
         you don’t know her. but given those operatives held the door open for her and now stand next to it, seemingly guarding the whole establishment, tells you enough. a very high ranking fatua is sitting right here in your bar, looking at you with a distant, sharp gaze. she did not have normal eyes, but red crosses where an iris is supposed to be. she looks at you intently, as if to observe every single one of your moves. you begin to wonder if your dad, who had a criminal past, had messed with the fatui at some point; but you quickly realized that not even he would be so stupid.
         “a glass of red, please. sweet, if you do have so.” she speaks slowly, her voice rather deep. you nod, your eyes not leaving her face for another second or five, and despite the unease you’re feeling in your gut, there is also something else. something more.

         you quickly prepare the glass; polished to perfection, you poured some of the finest red wine all of mondstadt had to offer. you didn’t dare to avert your eyes from the matter and meet those staring at you consistently.
         “here you go,” you say casually, wanting to treat her like any other customer. after all, she, too, was a guest in your establishment. if she were to cause trouble, you would throw her out just like you would all those drunken knights.
         “thank you,” she responded with a slightly hoarse voice. a black hand crept up from underneath the bar, carefully wrapping slender fingers around the glass. you spotted some rings and a tattoo on the back of her hand. your thoughts wandered as you turned around and tended to the dishes again. it was crowded evening, after all.
