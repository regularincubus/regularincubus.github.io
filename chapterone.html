      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fragments of our Reverie - Preview</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your hands smell faintly of juniper, citrus and a hint of sunsettia puree. a barkeeper&rsquo;s tend to do so &mdash; sweet deliciousness lifting the spirits around you, yet that same smell is stained with the memory of half-drunk glasses and customers who never quite know when to leave. their groans and cries echo in your ear every evening, and you wish you could have the same ear piece like the akademiya&rsquo;s scribe. from what you know, he was a calm presence. and you had no doubt the silence he surrounded himself with was part of it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you&rsquo;ve never been in sumeru, never really left mondstadt for all it&rsquo;s worth. if anything, the most you traveled was the commute between dornman port and the city of mondstadt. not that you were complaining - solitude and peace were much preferred over the troublesome and bustling life of those from the adventurer&rsquo;s guild. you didn&rsquo;t envy them, yet sometimes you couldn&rsquo;t help but worry about bennett and his friends. the scars and wounds they carry around surely stem from long, hard-won battles. you once mixed a concoction per barbara&rsquo;S request. she herself had been busy that day - a long expedition, leaving plenty harmed and at barbatos&rsquo; mercy. and you were one of the few people she would trust with something like this- measuring out the correct amounts to the last digit on the scale. she thanked you with some of her spicy energy drinks. you don&rsquo;t drink them, but mix some in the drinks of those, who should have long left, but unnecessarily push their limits and other people&rsquo;s comfort zones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">no one had been aware of your little trick just yet, despite everyone knowing you by heart. your finesse, your demeanour, your efficiency; yes, you truly made both the angel&rsquo;s share and the cat&rsquo;s tail look like cheap establishments on your best nights. multiple orders in a row, and when the waiters and waitresses already practiced their resignation speech, you pushed through, serving customer after customer, drunkard over drunkard with practiced ears open enough for the dockworkers to trust you, and long enough for the sailors to spill even the nastiest of secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you pour their wine. you mix their rum. you listen to their foolish boasts, their tired confessions, their half-sung sea shanties that never reach the right key. and you like it, truly; stepping into your father&rsquo;s footsteps has never felt more right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your anxieties, the usual ones that kept on nagging on you, eating away every ounce of safety you have created for yourself; they were at bay, whenever the shaker was in your hand, when you could feel the weight of dandelion wine, some mint, three ice cubes and a splash of sweet flower in your hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was your signature drink tonight; one many had anticipated. diona and you were awake for ages that night, the bar in the cats tail a certified mess as the feline girl munched on some canned sardines.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t even know why you would want it to taste good. i&rsquo;d always show these drunkards how disgusting this brew is!&rdquo; she exclaimed, laying on the couch. she rested her legs against the backrest, her hand dangling free above the ground. it was then when you realized how young she truly was, and you smiled to yourself, as you added the last leaf of mint to the shaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was always the same. repetitive work, always working the closing shift since that's all your sleep schedule allowed. you wouldn&rsquo;t want it any other way; no, you came to love this routine, the people, the regulars. chatting and occasionally downing a shot in one go, impressing the old fellas, who did not think that someone as young as you could take it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you listen and you observe; and somewhere in between their stories, you polish the counter and used glasses until they gleam like the morning sun on cider lake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is always the same. and you couldn&rsquo;t complain, even if you tried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet, despite the monotonous routine of a rising barkeeping genius, even you could not escape the cold breeze coming in, as two fatui operatives opened the door. you ignored them, while everyone else started watching and staring as if seeing something alien; as if barbatos himself came back in person. you could hear the whispers; the hissing and muttering. some were rude, some were disrespectful, while others began to tremble in fear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">honestly, you didn&rsquo;t understand either. so far, any activity from the fatui in mondstadt was very much not like in the other nations. they mostly stayed at goth hotel anyway, and except for sometimes occupying sara due to a seemingly shared break at midday, there is nothing you could complain about. they were friendly, despite their status - not that you would openly defend them; else someone might as well send the knights of favonius on your neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the tavern doors groan open against the salt-stained wood, agonizingly slow. the faint scent of sea spray, the bite of autumn chill; a hint of smoke from some distant ship. an all too familiar mixture of the beauty of dornman port. candles flicker. one of them gutters out completely, and you raise a brow at just how long the two women would hold the door open. any longer and you might need to tell them to tune it down. great.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">however, it isn&rsquo;t before long when a long, slender figure enters the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for a moment, no one turns, all eyes set on the door and the person walks slowly; her heels clicking on the ground in a shrill, piercing tone. you don&rsquo;t look - knowing what fuss the others made, you had no interest in making a customer feel uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">they don&rsquo;t rush, their steps measured, deliberate. like someone who belongs in every space they enter, whether welcomed or not. someone mutters </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">fatui.</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> not loud, but enough for you to hear. the word drifts like a cold draft through the room, and you try to ignore the ringing in your ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you felt a chair shift at the bar; heard the faint sound of fabric on the cheap lather as someone sat down behind you. you finished cleaning the glass you had been working on and turned around in a swift motion, the air being knocked right out of your lungs as you saw her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you don&rsquo;t know her. but given those operatives held the door open for her and now stand next to it, seemingly guarding the whole establishment, tells you enough. a very high ranking fatua is sitting right here in your bar, looking at you with a distant, sharp gaze. she did not have normal eyes, but red crosses where an iris is supposed to be. she looks at you intently, as if to observe every single one of your moves. you begin to wonder if your dad, who had a criminal past, had messed with the fatui at some point; but you quickly realized that not even he would be so stupid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;a glass of red, please. sweet, if you do have so.&rdquo; she speaks slowly, her voice rather deep. you nod, your eyes not leaving her face for another second or five, and despite the unease you&rsquo;re feeling in your gut, there is also something else. something more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you quickly prepare the glass; polished to perfection, you poured some of the finest red wine all of mondstadt had to offer. you didn&rsquo;t dare to avert your eyes from the matter and meet those staring at you consistently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;here you go,&rdquo; you say casually, wanting to treat her like any other customer. after all, she, too, was a guest in your establishment. if she were to cause trouble, you would throw her out just like you would all those drunken knights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;thank you,&rdquo; she responded with a slightly hoarse voice. a black hand crept up from underneath the bar, carefully wrapping slender fingers around the glass. you spotted some rings and a tattoo on the back of her hand. your thoughts wandered as you turned around and tended to the dishes again. it was crowded evening, after all. no time to slack off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as you kept on polishing the glasses, faintly listening to the banter of some customers here and there, her gaze stayed on you. you didn&rsquo;t turn around, but you felt more watched than usual, as if every single movement of yours was being carefully taken apart.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was interesting. usually it was just the men looking at you like this; watching you as you did what you&rsquo;re good at, followed by comments on how they wished their &lsquo;girls&nbsp; were as careful, thorough and quick as you are. you could barely take it as a compliment, knowing some poor women choose to go to bed every night sleeping next to the epitomes of disrespect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet with her, it felt different. it felt lighter, more sincere, and in no means predatory or uncomfortable. maybe she was observing? perhaps she was investigating? you were not deep enough in the fatui business to properly understand what they even did in such public places, nor did you care much. she was your customer, and as you just saw - a customer who just finished her wine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;can i pour you another one?&rdquo; you ask politely as you swing the towel over your shoulder. you smiled friendly, yet she didn&rsquo;t seem moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;very much so.&rdquo; she said and started to fold her hands together on the table. &ldquo;and, if you see fit, i would like to ask you a question about the port. my children and i are here for the first time, so it&rsquo;s only natural for us to wonder about certain&hellip; customs of the locals, or so to speak.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she&rsquo;s here with her children? did you miss a toddler or two entering the bar?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">quickly minding your business again, you nod and get the wine bottle. uncorking it, you pour her some more while thinking of a response. the way she talks is terrifyingly precise and embellished to an extent that lets you know that she is here for a reason other than a quick pause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;well,&rdquo; you start, slightly flustered at the way she keeps on staring at you. &ldquo;the sailors are one of a kind, never ones to shy away from the bottom of a bottle.&rdquo; you said and closed the wine bottle again. &ldquo;and they always want company while enjoying their beverages. it&rsquo;s common for people on sea to do that, although i found the people in liyue to not be so.. excessive.&rdquo; you chuckled softly and turn away from this woman.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;ah, yes, i had heard.&rdquo; she said, maybe a little dreamily? it was hard to tell, and you hadn&rsquo;t expected anything else from someone of her status. whatever exactly that might be.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i always found such people a little&hellip; difficult to deal with. you see, as someone who was born in the court of fontaine, i have no experience with seamen. it was only after i took on my current position, that i truly understood what it meant to go by sea, and that dulled my understanding of this excessive alcohol consumption.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;though this wine would do good for a present, i must admit.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you turned towards her and were greeted with a smile. letting out a huff, you returned it, pulling the towel off your shoulder. &ldquo;indeed. many visitors and guests take some wine home. uh, all kinds of custom made ships and other souvenirs are popular, too. and especially among children.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the woman seemed unfazed, yet a smile slowly adorned her face. &ldquo;that&rsquo;s rather pleasant information. i&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing such lovely souvenirs for myself, then.&rdquo; she said, raising her glass and bringing it to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she looked awfully content like this - confident in a very polite manner she hadn&rsquo;t displayed previously. she certainly was an interesting person; her presence taking over the entire room, the conversations and voices of the customers still dull and mere whispers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you wondered who she was; wondered what exactly brought her here. there was a saying, something mona once babbled away when she was deep into her third glass of wine - a classic lightweight, not that you were complaining. hearing about her master always brought a smirk to your face mona was sure to get upset over.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;the fatui are-&rdquo; hiccup &ldquo;never there without a reason,&rdquo; she babbled</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and you wondered what she meant by that ever since.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">their reputation was tarnished, sure, yet no fatuus had ever dared to make a bad move on you or your establishment. the residents of goth hotel seemed peaceful, as well as mikhail and lyudmila. in fact, it is often that you greet them, whenever you are in mondstadt, and they make sure to return the gesture with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you took in that woman&rsquo;s appearance; her black hands and unique eyes, the tattoos and rings and nails. you didn&rsquo;t spot a vision, nor a delusion. whatever they look like, anyway, since the rumors don&rsquo;t say anything about that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her hair was unlike anything you&rsquo;ve seen before, and you were glad that the hair clip revealed a rather long ponytail behind the failed attempt of a bowl cut. black and white hair, from what you could gather anyways - long and thin and for the first time you felt like you could finally relate to the looks of a woman in this establishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">no matter how much of a worker they were, they always had such voluminous hair. maybe it was the salty breeze of the sea?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as you looked away, another customer sat down at the bar. at the opposite end of your fatui-guests. you understood. but it&rsquo;s still a little dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you quickly tended to his needs - an apple cider, and you immediately brushed him off again, softly of course. he was wasted already, not so much of a pleasant mixture, given a fatua is currently sipping your finest wine at the other end of the bar. one wrong word or move, and this could get ugly, so let&rsquo;s not provoke it. you turn away from the man, who slurps his cider down like a child that just came home from a long day at the beach.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the woman raised her hand and you approached her again. a smile formed on her face again; you knew she was plotting something. whatever it was. not even the nicest of sailors here were so pretentious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;as much as i enjoyed this beverage, i was just informed that i&rsquo;m needed elsewhere.&rdquo; she said and leaned back in her chair. &ldquo;however, i have greatly enjoyed this establishment and perhaps i shall return at a later point during my stay.&rdquo; she rose from the chair and you follow her head like a curious kitten. one of her subordinates comes forward and leaves a small bag on the table - it sounds of mora and is much cleaner than most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;ll make sure to repay you for your service, too. it must be hard, being a young person in such an extraordinary business. may i have a name?&rdquo; she says and turned around already. you stared at her back, her ponytail, the vision hidden beneath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; you say, rather quietly and swallow, the sudden nervousness slowly wrapping around your throat. you were usually trained in concealing it all while at work, years of carefully mastering this to pursue what you were best at. and yet, she made it crumble almost instantly; yet you couldn&rsquo;t muster up why. something had changed about her aura, too, yet her smile remained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll make sure to remember that.&rdquo; she said and left, her subordinates following right behind her. you took the bag and stuffed it into your pocket, quickly turning around and getting back to cleaning the same few glasses over and over again. the image of this mysterious woman never leaving your mind.</span></p>
