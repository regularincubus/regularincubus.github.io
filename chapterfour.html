  <h3>Chapter Four</span></h3>
  <p>&ldquo;do you think you&rsquo;ll see her again?&rdquo; she asked as she leaned against you. she looked up in the
    sky, fiddling with the plush saurian.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;huh? how did you come up with her again?&rdquo; you ask as you lean your head on top of hers. you could tell
    she was nervous, constantly trying to shift the conversation elsewhere. it was a long journey, but it was one that
    klee already took on, so diona should be fine. you yourself never went there, but you heard a story or two from
    sailors after the sakoku decree was disbanded back then.</span></p>
  <p>it&rsquo;s said the nation had gotten much lighter, calmer and more idyllic, too. perhaps one day, you could see it
    for yourself, but as of right now, you had no reason to.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i know you! you&rsquo;ve been thinking about her all week, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asks with a hint of
    annoyance in her voice. while with everyone else, you would maybe feel a little offended, you knew diona was
    differenz. a tiny soul plagued by massive abandonment issues nonetheless; you two got along well for that reason,
    too, amongst countless of other, smaller things.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;maybe?&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;maybe not. i don&rsquo;t see a reason as to why i would tell you.&rdquo; you
    tease her and smile. she turns her head hectically, looks at you with wide eyes.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;so you won&rsquo;t- no, you don&rsquo;t want to tell me? me?! your best friend?&rdquo; she gets louder and
    you bite your lip. &ldquo;pff, fine.&rdquo; she turned away from you, crossed her arms in front of her, pressing
    lapras against her in the process.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;you know i&rsquo;ll still come visit when you&rsquo;re back? i doubt anything will change. i asked around
    and well, turns out she is not just any fatui, but a harbinger.&rdquo; you finally confess after days of bickering.
    suddenly, the young girl turns towards you again, her eyes now wide in shock.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;you casually talked to a harbinger?&rdquo; she asked in a shriek. &ldquo;a harbinger? like, one of the very
    dangerous guys?&rdquo; you nodded again.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;she wasn&rsquo;t, though. she was nice, gentle even. and very respectful.&rdquo; you say, maybe a little too
    dreamily, which elicited a huff from the young barkeeper. &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;but
    whatever. it&rsquo;s a crush anyway.&rdquo; she mumbles and you try your best to not extend your arms and pull her
    into them. &ldquo;not like you would ever talk to her or anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>in that moment, you realized two things:</span></p>
  <p>you really, really wanted to talk to arlecchino. even if it would just be a civil, rather business oriented
    conversation - but you needed to hear her voice, listen to her breathing and her chuckles, as superficial as they
    were. you had no clue why you were reacting like this, like a cat in heat but with the burning need to listen and
    interact instead of sexual lust.</span></p>
  <p>well, maybe a bit of that, too.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll see about that.&rdquo; you smile and spend the next few minutes in silence. in the distance, you
    hear footsteps approaching and a voice you would recognize anywhere, with a pronunciation of dionas name like no
    other.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;diona! huh, vanessa? hello! nice to see you again!&rdquo; xiangling exclaimed and waved, guoba trying to
    keep up with her insanely quick pace.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>the plan was to have her escort diona to liyue, and from there a captain called beidou would set sail to inazuma
    and take diona with her. all neatly organized by yours truly, xiangling herself, since she did not entrust little
    diona with anyone except for people he seemingly deemed capable. they were good friends, and diona talked about her
    a lot in the recent letters.</span></p>
  <p>according to her, foraging ingredients and developing all kinds of seemingly disgusting recipes was fun, although
    xianglings extraordinary ideas did turn out to be rather delicious in the end. strange.</span></p>
  <p>it wasn&rsquo;t long and diona was hugging you tight, waving you good bye as she went on a long journey to faraway
    lands you didn&rsquo;t even dream of stepping on, though of course you wouldn&rsquo;t say no if the opportunity
    arises.</span></p>
  <p>dionas departure at midday meant that your own departure wouldn&rsquo;t have to wait long anymore. tonight,
    you&rsquo;ll march back to dornman port. eula and the company were not on patrol, which made you slightly uneasy,
    but you were very excited to be back. spending time with your mother had been a bit challenging the past few days,
    so you were looking forward to the quiet, ordinary life back at the port.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>and although the chances stood fifty fifty, you were hoping to see her again; arlecchino, with her white, black and
    red hair, extraordinary black and red eyes -&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>you stopped yourself mid-thought. chuckled, even, if only to yourself in your head.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>god, this woman was a lot. a lot of weird things, perhaps. and you wondered what was up with the black on her arms.
    if the marks she had there were tattoos, and why the undersides of her nails were red, too. either way, whoever she
    was, </span><em>number four of the fatui harbingers</span></em>, she certainly was interesting. and unlike many
    other people, you did not immediately jump to ill conclusions about said fact. of course, exercising caution would
    be the best possible way to go about all this, and so you planned, but you would never ban her from the
    establishment. she was a paying customer like no other, and a very well-paying customer at that. so no reason to
    turn her away.</span></p>
  <p>but no reason to let her slip through your fingers either.</span></p>
  <p>to be entirely honest, there was no particular goal in mind. you did not want to try to wrap her around your
    finger. you were certain a fatui harbinger would not be so easy to impress, also didn&rsquo;t think that would work
    so easily on her, either. there was nothing about her that said she would be open for such an encounter, and on a
    regular day, you would also speculate about the sexuality of the person you think is attractive, the person you
    might want to flirt with just a tiny bit.</span></p>
  <p>but seriously, after looking at her? there was no way she was not into women.</span></p>
  <p>and so you spent the remainder of the day packing up your stuff, sneaking into the library to return a book on
    dionas behalf, careful not to meet the local librarian, and just enjoying the last bits of the warm evening sun that
    day.</span></p>
  <p>and when it was ultimately time to leave, you waved your mother goodbye, and were on your way again. working,
    traveling, visiting. that was your life - as simple as it was efficient, with people you enjoyed being around. the
    rather rare special occasion, a birthday or the weinlesefest - even those were enjoyable with the comfort of knowing
    tomorrow will be just like any other day again. and you wouldn&rsquo;t have it any other way.</span></p>
  <p>so naturally, you didn&rsquo;t have any expectations. and trying to get under a harbingers&rsquo; skin was
    certainly something to brag about. not that you would, of course, but generally speaking. the fact alone makes the
    corner of your mouth turn upwards, as it starts raining in the middle of the night; the carriage struggling to keep
    up with the rather fast pace.</span></p>
  <p>though, what would it look like?</span></p>
  <p>she comes in and instead of your usually reserved outerior, you just dive straight in there?&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>wouldn&rsquo;t feel like you were yourself. you had to be a little more cool about it all, just a tad bit more sass
    in the responses and more confidence in how you presented yourself. essentially, you wanted her to see you as if you
    could meet her ego up there, eye-to-eye, and that was a hard task, considering how she came across. a little
    self-absorbed, or at least very close to it.</span></p>
  <p>the rain kept on falling, but the carriage was able to keep up. you arrived in dornman port early in the morning.
    it was around four, and you booked the evening shift, so you had plenty of time to rest.</span></p>
  <p>maybe it was a little unfair that even on days like this you had to work, but that only meant more pay for you. and
    at least like that your coworkers could enjoy some days off. summer was almost there, and you already reserved your
    time off for this busy season months ago, blocking the time for most of your colleagues. a vile move, in the minds
    of some- but pure, planned relaxation for you.</span></p>
  <p>the walk back to your grandmother&rsquo;s house was longer than usual. your body was in need of some rest, some
    warmth, too. and you hoped that diona slept well on the ship to inazuma; if there was rain and storm in mondstadt,
    surely liyue would be affected the following day. at least you hoped it would wait that long.</span></p>
  <p>you were walking past the bar and out of habit, looked around. it was a sunday, so there would be no construction
    whatsoever; thus, the streets were empty at this hour. although in the far distance, you thought you could make out
    a strange shadow; but that was probably just the many unkempt bushes that had yet to be properly
    pruned.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>summer was upon you, and so was excruciatingly hot weather. the thirst of the people grew- both because it was
    exhausting to merely exist and breathe, and because summer gave people a purpose; because the night life thrived
    upon the first shorter nights.</span></p>
  <p>you didn&rsquo;t dislike it. but when you were younger, you enjoyed summer more. it made you feel uncomfortably hot
    at times; as if you were burning from the inside out. and you would like to avoid that as much as you could,
    spending your days off in the cold embrace of your grandmothers living room or during the evening shifts at the
    bar.</span></p>
  <p>now that you thought about it, you really hit a jackpot with your planning, smiling to yourself as you
    realized.</span></p>
  <p>you kept on walking, down the dead and empty street. one of the street lights was broken, had been for years. it
    was all so familiar, and yet, so unique. you wondered how other people perceived this small haven of a
    port.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>was it just a beautiful destination for the next vacation? was it a sunny spot for the next field
    trip?&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>and did people even walk through those streets, apart and away from the main street? getting to know even the
    tiniest of spark of ordinary life, that was much like the one those in mondstadt lived? that the natives to dornman
    port were people like you and me - workers, cooks, children who studied just like everyone else. you wondered if
    people saw behind the destination, behind the travelling through - wondered if </span><em>she</span></em> had a
    grasp of it all. she seemed smart enough to do so, and maybe that&rsquo;s exactly why you thought of all this in the
    first place. maybe because you hoped to be more than just a waiter to her, maybe she could see the person behind it
    all, even though you didn't hide anything. lots of people were just slow on catching up.</span></p>
  <p>maybe she was the one who could finally see all of you.</span></p>
  <p>a random shiver ran down your spine, the bushes rustled and the wind picked up. time to get home; time to think and
    brainstorm on how you could seduce number four of the fatui harbingers.</span></p>
  <p>or at the very least, startle her a little.</span></p>
