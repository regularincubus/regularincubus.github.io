    <h1>Chapter Ten</h1>
      <p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;-and now i am beyond confused&rdquo; you say, burying your head in your knees.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were sitting on monas bed; she had come to visit her parents a few days ago, and as per usual, you met up around this time of year. usually it was very nice, yet after receiving the letter about your questions regarding fontaine, and upon hearing you out on your recent encounters with the knave, all she could do was scoff.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;this is ridiculous!&rdquo; she said, turning away from whatever work she was doing and looking at you with the convincing look of a trained astrologist, who just had to somehow tell people their partly horrible fates every single day. it wasn&rsquo;t new to you, not anymore, and it didn&rsquo;t even intimidate you the first time she looked at you like this. and yet, you felt yourself melting away under her gaze.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;travelling to fontaine? with someone like that?&rdquo; she snarled at you. &ldquo;you could have just asked me if you wanted it so badly. but with a harbinger? are you out of your mind?&rdquo;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">sitting on your desk at home in silence somehow felt deafening today. staring at your newly acquired vision didn&rsquo;t make it any better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">this wasn&rsquo;t an easy decision. depending on what you chose, you would leave behind a whole life filled with good memories and stability. of course, returning would always be an option, but trying to get rid of the reputation of working with a harbinger, willingly at that, would put a strain on your reputation. and of course, the bar might go to ruins if you kept your job, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&rsquo;s truly a shame how close-minded people were when it came to the fatui. of course, it was an organization with many mistakes, but so were the knights, the millelith, the gardes; everything had its flaws. and yet most people only pointed their finger at things they don&rsquo;t know a single thing about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, what is there to know about them in your case? you trusted her, of course you did. maybe her operatives, too. but the others? and if you were to stay at the house of the hearth; wouldn&rsquo;t countless of children be around you at all times? or at least during certain times? surely she wouldn&rsquo;t have you locked away in a chamber all alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">not that you would mind, honestly. alone time like this gave you plenty of time for research, uncovering even the deepest of truths and maybe finally decoding that old khaenri&rsquo;ahn book you had gotten. it was getting on your nerves, flipping through the pages but not finding any source material for anything - the names written in it made less sense the more days went by and you slowly but steadily came to the conclusion that you would need to take a break at some point. and yet, you couldn&rsquo;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">once you set your mind on something, you will easily push through, no matter what. even if it came to a mystery such as this. after all, you got a vision for a reason.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">well, whatever that reason was, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you began to feel the shift in your life. one day, this woman appeared and suddenly you were just about working for her, suddenly being able to yield the power of dendro, and were thinking about moving away from everything you&rsquo;ve ever known. it was a scary thought, indeed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">social life aside, your body troubled you. you looked at the travel route. it would either be a long cruise, or an incredible long hike, and cruise, and however you would survive in the sumeru desert. it was a lot to think about, a lot to consider, and you found yourself to be lost if you thought about it too much. it overwhelmed you, slightly, and you could feel something bigger approaching if this nagging feeling would persist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you wanted to avoid that at all costs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">playing with the vision in your hand, you let out a loud sigh. you buried your head in your arms, closing your eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but still, all you could see was her.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her eyes, her smile, her arms, her fingers; you could hear her voice, faintly calling out for you. it was torture. the sweetest one, but still. you really did not want to indulge in those feelings for much longer, and yet, you found yourself unable to shift your thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so perhaps you could indulge them just this once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;so, did you come to a conclusion?&rdquo; she said softly. you couldn&rsquo;t see her, but instead could hear her as if she was right next to you. you shook your head in response to the ghost calling out for you; silly as it might have been.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i see. i must say, i do not find myself surprised. but, just to make myself clear again, i would need an answer. soon, in fact.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">i know, you thought. i know, it&rsquo;s just- so damn complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;fret not&rdquo; she said, and her voice came closer. &ldquo;you do realize that i will protect you throughout our voyage?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your eyes widened slightly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course you would, but-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh, there is no such thing as a simple &lsquo;but&rsquo;, i fear&rdquo; she said, softer than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i will protect you, no matter the cost. you see, i do have a few tricks up my sleeve after all, and there is nothing i wouldn&rsquo;t do to see you unharmed.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but, why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you felt defeated, stupidly defeated just for how tight the ache in your chest had gotten. and perhaps it was just a little bit pathetic. perhaps; but who would judge you on that? for slowly falling for this woman in a way you had never fallen before; without an end in sight, an endless limbo underneath your feet and with each passing day, it only got worse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;do you understand, vanessa?&rdquo; she whispered, and you felt something akin to a fingertip on your cheek. you leaned into it reflexively, ignoring just how real it felt, just how right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">this right now felt like more than just a dream. it was a soothing balm that slowly wrapped itself around your wounded soul. and to be entirely honest? maybe you needed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the closeness, the words, the slight shiver it sent down your spine. it was unfamiliar, and yet, it felt like home. although part of you wanted to hold onto the distance, the comfortable gap between you and her - in status, interests, and in strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the problem was, that you felt a pull towards her. as if a voice told you that she was not all too different from you after all. that there was something; something that didn&rsquo;t let your ideals and values separate, but rather merge together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">something that let you both become one. just like you had always imagined it to be. and maybe, just maybe, you should give in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">maybe after those tiresome years of staying behind the bar, tending to people with seemingly no end in sight; maybe it was time for you to leave it behind. if a mere dream with her was like this, how would reality be? of course, you would not be so close, and surely if you ever got to this level, it would take a long time; and yet, you were ready to wait. for no matter how long.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">even if it would take you a lifetime, something inside you told you it was worth it. and to other people, this thought seemed scary, intimidating, foreign. yet to you, it was the very thing you&rsquo;ve secretly wanting to feel for some time now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you could do well without love in your life. after all, you never craved it, having gotten way too much in your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, with her so close; with this flame burning brighter and brighter each day - for the first time in what seemed like years you found yourself craving closeness, intimacy, warmth, even.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that was not overwhelming. that felt good, it felt right and oh so deliciously pleasing the more you thought about it. a sense of what you would describe as internal peace, although you have long reached it, began to bloom within your body. perhaps it would not be so bad after all; you wouldn&rsquo;t lose your family, and surely your friends would understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and honestly, you could always find another job.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">someone would easily hire you. you lived up to your fathers legacy, being one of the most well-known waiters in all of mondstadt. yet unlike him, you never travelled to any events; that small bar in dornman port was enough to keep you busy and occupied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;do you understand?&rdquo; she asked again, a finger of hers slightly scratching along your throat. under normal circumstances, this sheer action would make you weak in the knees, but for now, you kept yourself steady. the safety of knowing that all of this is a dream induced by who-knows-what comforted you immensely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when you opened your eyes, eyelids heavy with something akin to exhaustion after such a powerful display of your imagination, you saw a small root floating in the air. immediately, you flinched away, the force of you raising your head made your neck crack uncomfortably, and you almost fell over in your chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet you could do nothing but stare at it, the mysterious floating root, and then the dendro vision on your table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you swallowed, the idea in your head was as simple as can be. and after reaching out for your vision, grabbing it tightly with your hand, the root moved alongside you, following every twitch of your fingers. it was fascinating. having the power to create such life forms, although if only artificially. and you were sure it would disappear. somehow, at least.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">if not, you&rsquo;d be stuck with a root in your room. perhaps that could be a great conversation starter for one of your chats with her. you noticed she had been staring at plants and trees rather intensely upon walking past them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the vision felt alive in your hands. you couldn&rsquo;t explain it any other way. its slight glow didn&rsquo;t make it any better, but that was all the more proof for what you were about to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">just a few days later, she stepped inside the bar. approaching you with a slight smile, and a curious expression when she looked at your arm. there were some scratches that were rather unusual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to elderly people you know, it was a cat you played with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to everyone you trusted, it was you experimenting with your vision, trying out what else you could create with it. and it only grew more fascinating with each passing day. surely if you were more into alchemy, you would have the time of your life with your new asset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she sat down and you immediately put a glass in front of her. you gave her water this time, the lemonade had yet to rest for a little longer to fully develop the unique flavours. although she could probably imagine that this was the cause of the absence of her favorite beverage, she raised a brow in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">at least you had the decency to put a slice of lemon and some ice cubes in the glass to not make it look all too half-assed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">before she could even talk, you handed her a rather thin file. it was new, so obviously not one of those old scrapbooks you dealt with every night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;may i ask what this is, or would you rather have me open it first?&rdquo; she asked, looking at you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as you met her eyes, you realized how much smaller she is whenever she sits. it&rsquo;s a funny sight, truly magnificent nonetheless. the evening sun was shining into her face from the side, casting soft shadows all over her fragile face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and she does look kind of cute like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;my termination of my contract here&rdquo; you said plainly. &ldquo;as well as the documents needed to withdraw from my grandmother&rsquo;s house. i&rsquo;ll be a registered traveller the day after tomorrow. didn&rsquo;t join the adventurers guild, that would have taken it too far.&rdquo; you chuckle, more to yourself than anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was silent for some time. the door creaked open softly and the first guests of the evening rush came in. you needed to settle this matter rather quickly, else talking to her would prove to be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose you&rsquo;re interested in joining me, then?&rdquo; she asked, the slightest hint of a smile on her face. you nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; you said simply. besides, this was arlecchino. was there truly anything else you needed to say? this woman could read minds if she wanted to, and you&rsquo;re more than sure that she knows this was still no easy decision after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;very well&rdquo; she said and pushed the file to your direction again. &ldquo;i think those would be better suited if they stayed with you. wouldn&rsquo;t want to get in trouble due to the missing paperwork on the way, would you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and you could hear the underlying smile, and maybe the bits of enthusiasm in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but nevertheless, you managed to stay calm. taking the files again, putting them underneath the counter to put away at a later, more convenient time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you might be right about that.&rdquo; you said and smiled at her. your eyes met hers again, and for once, those red crosses lost a little of their edge and sharpness. as you focused on it, all the people entering the bar; the sailors and merchants and regulars - all of them faded away into an isolating little blur. one you would happily ignore, as long as she was in there with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;well then, vanessa&rdquo; she began, averting her gaze from you. &ldquo;do you have any, even if just rough, estimation as to when you could bestow a glass of lemonade on me?&rdquo;</span></p>
