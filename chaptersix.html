    <h1>Chapter Six</h1>
      <p>
        <h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chapter Six</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">morning came soon enough, and with it, another dreadful day. despite the happenings of the day before yesterday, you decided to let it go. at least as much as you could, which to be honest, wasn&rsquo;t by a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the news took you by surprise, much more than anything else ever did, and yet, something new was being set aflame seemingly overnight: the burning desire to find out the truth. find out if those fatui even spoke the whole truth; find out if she was still alive. because there was no way a huge flood took number four of the fatui harbingers and no one seemingly bat an eye. there must be more to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so when you woke up today and got dressed, you ran off to get the newspaper of today, mentally taking notes that you would need to ask your grandfather to hand you yesterday&rsquo;s copy, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you would need to work again, later of course, so you had all morning and possibly all night to gather information about the wellbeing of the nation of hydro and arlecchinos whereabouts. because if there was something you&rsquo;d trust rather than some fatui gossip, it&rsquo;s your own damn gut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">newspaper in hand, you decided to sit down on a rather lonely bench near the shore of the port. it was lively at this time, yet everyone was busy trying to get to the beach as soon as possible, not wanting to waste any more time to get the best possible spot. no one cared about you and you basked in that sensation; one of the many great things about living here was that no one cared. everyone knew their stay and their acquaintances were temporary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you skimmed through the pages. something about a new eating contest in inazuma, hosted by some man with horns; new research breakthroughs in sumeru, the traveling merchant you&rsquo;ve gotten the plushie for diona from was making headlines with a new product she sells. nothing spectacular. and yet, on the last page there was a column, rather small, about what happened in fontaine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">apparently a huge flood overtook the court of fontaine - the very heart of the nation. some things were damaged, for sure, but a so-called prophecy and a crisis that came along with it, could be averted. whatever that meant again?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">one of the few negative things about dornman port is that getting a good newspaper in the morning was about as impossible as finding sober people in the afternoon. most ships only arrived at midday, and before that there was only the local paper getting out some news that mostly revolved around mondstadt and some international things. never anything big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you remembered finding out about inazuma getting out of lockdown through sailors arriving at the port, not through the newspapers that even arrived a day later back then. it was disastrous, but to be expected. the sea routes are packed, and the land around dornman port was as dangerous as it could get; hence why the grandmaster was to arrive here in a few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were not looking forward to meeting him. it is said his appetite for booze is even bigger than the claymore he yields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">back to the topic at hand; the column didn&rsquo;t teach you anything. there weren&rsquo;t even any pictures, nothing of importance that could hint at anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so, naturally, you tried to remember as much as you could from your previous conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she was a father. whyever that was; a father of many children, for that matter. knowing her heritage of being a fatui harbinger, what could that mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">was she the leader of some kind of organization? crime rates in fontaine were said to be polarizing. perhaps she was part of it? if so, why did she call her underlings her &lsquo;children&rsquo;? for someone her age, that surely must be a bit odd. on the other hand, you didn&rsquo;t know anything about the fatui and their titles. the streets say that one of the harbingers is referred to as &lsquo;rooster&rsquo;, and even that sounded a little silly in your ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for such political questions, it was always noteworthy to ask some mondstadt official for help. the problem was, however, that you didn&rsquo;t know about anyone who could be near. and your schedule didn&rsquo;t allow for a trip back to mondstadt any time soon. mona is still out of nation for some trip to-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">wait.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">mona was supposed to be in fontaine, too. and while you&rsquo;re sure she wouldn&rsquo;t be back in time, regardless of the catastrophe that happened, you knew someone who was in close contact with her, and someone whom you happen to be close with as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking at the clock, it was shortly before 10. if you made it to the postal office in time, there was still a possibility of receiving a letter back in due time, especially if she sends her raven out instead of waiting for the adventurers guild to carry out the delivery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you sprint, for the first time in a long time, and may trip trying to avoid a collision or three; but when you arrive at your destination, you have five minutes left, and you know you made it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you quickly scribble down two messages; one for mona and one for fischl. the former has some more detail and questions about fontaine, the latter is just a request of asking mona about the flood. both letters are sealed and brought away in due time; and perhaps a few extra mora made it possible to have those letters be tossed onto the very top of the carriage that will transport them to mondstadt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite your success, you feel a dull emptiness in your chest. the need to do more arises. you wouldn&rsquo;t even know what, despite for waiting for another few hours for the new newspapers. yet, you imagined that capturing moments or taking pictures of the fatui was just as hard a satisfying a sad sailor after a bad day; it just wasn&rsquo;t possible, and if it was, many sacrifices and restrictions would come with it. was there even a journalist suited for such a task? you didn&rsquo;t know, but that exact thought brought you new ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">surely wasting some more money on older newspapers was the way to go, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so, in a slower step this time, you made your way back to the newsstand of your trust; one that is not far from the shore you spent some time at earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you always had an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, so it wasn&rsquo;t new to you to research and read up about things for hours on end. you were more than willing to, especially when it&rsquo;s about something that interests you, something you cared about for whatever reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">but sometimes, those things do not need a reason. sometimes, your heart decides for you, and on the rare occasions it actually went against the logical aspect of your head, you still let it. and so far, it has only led you to good places, even if the journey was tough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so, after spending a few mora on magazines and newspapers from the past week, you decide to return home and get to work. after all, this business is becoming far too big to settle it on a bench at the shore.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you spend hours learning about the court of fontaine and its culture. you learn about the diverse sea life and how being a diver is a lonely, isolated business most of the time. something that might suit you and one of the few things you could see yourself trying out in life. in that regard, at least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you learn about magicians who are well-known, with many people from everywhere admiring their shows. you&rsquo;re not into the performing arts like that, but the thought of twins performing such a magic show is a very pleasant one. perhaps, if you go to fontaine one day, you could pay their show a visit, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you read about an organization that operates beyond the doings of the gardes - the official lawmaking force in fontaine; read about champion duelists and their job as executioners if someone wants to withstand trial; about the prison, the fortress of meropide, which left a bitter taste in your mouth; the big newspaper &lsquo;the steambird&rsquo;, and you remember mona telling you that she writes for them. and yet, you also remember how it keeps on being out of stock every single time you walk past the stand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">looking at the mess in front of you, scattered all over the bed, you knew this was no easy task. nothing contains even a single word about the fatui as a whole, much less about a singular harbinger. another point to consider might be reading up about the other nations, yet she said she was born in fontaine, said that her next operation would take her there. and you believed her, fact aside that you overheard that unpleasant statement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you looked at the clock; it was almost time for your shift. and with a final sigh, you put together the mess and decided to return to work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet, after the blink of an eye, it was nighttime, and you were home again. work was manageable, mostly spent with theorizing and thinking. about any possible links between a harbinger and the nation of justice, as ironic as it might be. if she had an underground organization, would it work beyond the gardes? or maybe she was the director of the prison? or at least had some business there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">nothing logical, or at least nothing with enough backing came to mind, and so you waited.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you waited and waited; a letter from fischl reached you soon. she said she reached out to mona. then, a day later, a letter from mona. she hadn&rsquo;t seen, nor heard anything; only felt a suspicious aura when coming close to fontaine&rsquo;s waters, whatever that meant in that context.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the newspapers kept on coming in, every day you spent money on multiple of them. nothing. only gossip from inazuma and the history of liyue reached you; not to mention the various preparations in mondstadt. all of them were waiting for the grandmaster to return. you didn&rsquo;t believe in such things. he always said he&rsquo;s be there, but never was; of course someone like him was practically the head of the nation of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you kept on waiting, a week passed, then two. news reached you, but nothing of importance. nothing relating to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet you kept going, trusting yourself that she was alive, that she would come back. for whatever reason. well, at the end of the day, she never said anything, only talked about returning to fontaine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps it was hopeless. perhaps it was useless, too, to act on the attachment you have built up after just two encounters and various daydreams. perhaps it was a little naive, too. and yet, when you were preparing the bar one day, a stack of newspapers on the floor next to you, you heard the door opening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry but we&rsquo;re still not quite ready to receive any guests. could i trouble you to wait outside?&rdquo; you ask, fixing the barrel of beer underneath the counter. it almost dropped straight onto your hand as you heard the voice of the previously unwelcomed guest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh? sending me away, already?&rdquo;</span></p>
