    <h1>Chapter Fifteen </h1>
<p>&ldquo;another one.&rdquo; she commanded, and you obviously obeyed. it&rsquo;s been two weeks since that barbecue, and two weeks filled with nothing but training. every evening you practically slumped down onto your bed before hiding away in a file or two, but all the physical activity was hard on you still. and it barely got better over time.</p>
<p>you focused hard enough and made three balls of pure elemental energy appear in your left hand. with an elegant swing, you threw them at her. she dodged easily, looking at you with a confused gaze. yet, judging by the smile you returned, you quickly called them back using only your mind, while keeping your hands behind your back.</p>
<p>just recently had she tied you to a post, saying this was for training purposes alone. truth be told, it aroused you. more than you would like to admit. and even after taking a suspicious long look at your flushed face and blown pupils, had she freed you. mere minutes of the sweetest torture, and you doubted she even realized what all of that did to you. perhaps it was for the best.</p>
<p>after finding out about her childhood, about clervie, about the lack of emotion she had lived with for so long, you doubted she would even properly realize that someone could care for her that deeply. although she wasn&rsquo;t stupid, in an emotional regard she was just like you - painfully oblivious, in the funniest of ways. how many attempted flirts had she blown away as if they were nothing but mere niceties? and how often did her confused eyes meet yours? it was a pity, really; someone this confident and strong-willed and intelligent, reduced to a mere pool of confusion whenever you complimented her.</p>
<p>perhaps it was also your way of talking to her that threw her off. admittedly so, you were never the type to just tell someone they look good. this was no flirting to you. maybe it was to her; maybe whomever she engaged with in the past &lsquo;flirted&rsquo; like this with her, or perhaps all of those experiences were shared with someone she had known already.</p>
<p>a co-worker seemed unlikely. she also didn&rsquo;t appear to have many friends. perhaps after you knocked her over, you could ask her that. she still owes you one answer though, and you have worked all day to get it from her.</p>
<p>fixing her clothing, she approached you, nodding. &ldquo;good job today, vanessa.&rdquo; she put her hand approvingly onto your shoulder squeezing softly. you didn&rsquo;t look at her when she said it, only listened to her silent voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;peruere.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i shall grant you another question tomorrow, if you insist. for now, i think it would be best to head back.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>you nodded, flabbergasted by the reveal.</p>
<p>it all started a week ago. to properly introduce you to the now regular training she would put you under, she would grant you a question after each successful objective you mastered. at first, you started off simple. you asked her if she felt like she had gotten her justice by killing crucabena, to which she replied with mixed feelings. yet, it was enough for you. then, two days later, you were allowed to ask how she liked her co-workers. she dislikes some of them, but with some, she is on friendly terms. or were; one of them died. a woman, by the name of &lsquo;la signora&rsquo;. you had heard about it, yet obviously never knew any details. not that she gave you much more, but you were satisfied.</p>
<p>a day later you asked her about her real name. it took you four whole days of trying to hit her with that newly developed attack of yours. you worked so hard on it, in fact, that some of the files you wanted to work on, already collected dust on your nightstand. but it was worth it. especially judging by the feeling of your own heartbeat hammering in your chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you did exceptionally well those past few days, therefore i will tell you a small secret about this name, if you are interested?&rdquo; she asked, looking at you. the warmth of her hand on your shoulder burned through your skin, your bones, your everything. knowing what happened to those arms was a tragedy, and yet you felt treasured by it. as <em>if barbatos himself bestowed a blessing upon you</em>, or so the sisters back at home would say.</p>
<p>you weren&rsquo;t a believer. not the biggest fan of the seven, either. if there was a higher being, then you would only hope for a happy life without any illnesses or other health problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but if such things like &lsquo;saints&rsquo; and &lsquo;blessings&rsquo; existed, then surely this woman could restore your faith in them, based only on the way she handles you when in combat, fake as it may be.</p>
<p>she is softer, and patient. well, she tends to be both anyway, with you at least, but something about standing opposite her, observing her and trying to imitate the moves she teaches you - something about that feel sacred to you, as if right now only the two of you exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;my name, as many do, has a shorter form. a nickname, by chance. it&rsquo;s &lsquo;perrie&rsquo;.&rdquo; she said and removed her hand, walking past you to undress her jacket again; shaking it off diligently as always.</p>
<p>&ldquo;perrie.&rdquo; you repeated quietly. &ldquo;so, what you&rsquo;re saying is that i now have a different name to call you?&rdquo; you smiled deviously, turning around to face her with a big grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;in private, i would have no problem with that. of course, this is no business for the children in any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i was teasing.&rdquo; you chuckled, but ultimately shrugged and decided to let it go. &ldquo;besides, i won&rsquo;t take orders for someone who only undressed after practice. think about it; perhaps seeing you without your jacket could give me just the last bits of motivation i need?&rdquo; you leaned forward, looking deeply into her eyes, studying her face. she seemed unfazed, and yet, a small smile waited at the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;against common belief, this counts as training for me, too. and it just so happens that i mostly operate with this jacket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;even in summer? fontaine is quite humid, don&rsquo;t you think? so you&rsquo;re fighting off all kinds of people with your sweat before burning them?&rdquo; you asked, clearly amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i suppose this is something you would take enjoyment from?&rdquo; she returned immediately, and you found yourself surprised at her seemingly new-found ability to actually <em>flirt back</em>.</p>
<p>repeating that in your head makes it more absurd than it actually is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t say no, honestly.&rdquo; you chuckled. you bit your lip softly, averting your gaze from hers. &ldquo;though, i would have something else in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;and you&rsquo;re sure she doesn&rsquo;t know of this place?&rdquo; you asked nervously, following the young diver with fervor.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;no. don&rsquo;t worry. father likes taking walks, but i doubt she would ever go there.&rdquo; he said, a slight smile on his face.</em></p>
<p><em>freminet was the first of the children who properly warmed up to you. funnily enough, you too, found him to be the shyest of the bunch, anxious and reserved as one could potentially be. and as of right now, you&rsquo;ve only heard snippets about his past.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>whenever you passed by him, you made sure to greet him with a smile. since he was so secretive about it, and you only knowing he is out diving for most of the time, it took you overhearing a conversation between lyney and lynette one day, to find out that he was into fairytales.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;he has a vast imagination, and prefers to hid his emotions, as well as live inside his head. many children face difficulties in understanding him. so i&rsquo;m sure a present from the guest would make him very happy.&rdquo; arlecchino said to you as you asked her one day how to approach him. fortunately it didn&rsquo;t take you multiple training sessions to get this out of her. for once. in fact, she gave you this answer for free.</em></p>
<p><em>well, almost. the next day you found yourself at the local newsstand. two books caught your attention. fables de fontaine, and something called perinheri. you bought them all, three books total; one as a present for freminet, the other two volumes for your own benefit. she had mentioned something along those lines in one of your conversations about the past, so perhaps it could help you with your research a little more.</em></p>
<p><em>and freminet deserved a present.</em></p>
<p><em>while you did not, and still do not intend to favor anyone, you need to start somewhere. the little ones seem to love you, and people like lyney and lynette appear to like you, too. but the quiet ones, the troubled ones, the ones that might need a moth-</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em> you didn&rsquo;t even allow yourself to finish thinking that thought. she had given herself the title of &lsquo;father&rsquo; for a reason. the mother, the one that abused and used her &lsquo;beloved&rsquo; children had been long gone. besides, you wouldn&rsquo;t even stay with the house forever. so why bother?</em></li>
</ol>
<p><em>but then again, one can dream. and sometimes, you allowed yourself such indulgence.</em></p>
<p><em>after gifting freminet the book, you spent a great evening together. he told you a bit about his favorite tales, told you the story of pers, and even that he, too, had met crucabena before she died. to think that arlecchino and freminet shared the same mother was strange, but that only shows how fresh and deep the wounds are after all.</em></p>
<p><em>a few days after the gift, and after many more warmer smiles and encounters, you asked freminet if he knew a place for you and his father to have a personal conversation. he, along with a few others, knew about the true reasons of your stay. about your job, your purpose. and he was happy to help, especially after you emphasized that you did not intend on taking his safe spots away from him. he, too, was a lot like you in many ways. his feelings towards self-preservation and safety among them.</em></p>
<p><em>he led you to a spot. secluded, near the shore, rainbow roses scattered everywhere. it was at the south of the court of fontaine, and only a few walls guarded this place. but, according to freminet, he hadn&rsquo;t seen anyone there in months. so the chances of someone appearing there on that one evening you would take her there were slim. not near zero, but honestly, when was it ever like that? if there is one thing you learned, it&rsquo;s that you can easily be watched. always. especially when being such a big figure like she was.</em></p>
<p><em>you thanked him, and promised him another gift. he declined, of course, polite as he was; but you had a small bow tie made specifically for pers, commissioned the inazuman tailor who worked in fontain for that purpose alone, even. you wouldn&rsquo;t let this opportunity go to waste.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;so, what i understand is that you want to take me to a secluded place. alone? isn&rsquo;t that what we&rsquo;ve been doing for the past week? if i didn&rsquo;t know any better, i would assume you brought me there to assassinate me.&rdquo; she said, linking her arms in front of her body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;oh please. assassinate you? don&rsquo;t have a reason to. besides, you&rsquo;re a good teacher, and i need someone to mess with on a daily basis, else i&rsquo;m not myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i never thought you to be such a playful individual.&rdquo; she said, a slight smile at the corner of her mouth. you merely shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, silent waters run deep, or so they say. so, want to come with me so i can assassinate you ruthlessly?&rdquo; you asked, a genuine expression on your face. your heart has barely ever beaten faster in your life, but you still held onto your calm facade. embarrassing yourself now wouldn&rsquo;t do much; besides, she had always been so polite, so even if she declined-</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course. as long as we arrive back at the house before daybreak, you may lead me wherever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>and you beamed at that.</p>
<p>shortly after, you were leading her to that place. freminet took you through currents of water, deep in the ocean, but you quickly found out how to avoid those. the suffocating feeling of the water, and yet being able to breathe freely while emerged, still gave you the chills.</p>
<p>so, a walk sufficed. a walk spent in comfortable silence. judging from solely her looks, and how she woke you up today - a gentle knocking, after you succumbed to the exhaustion of the past few days and couldn&rsquo;t get out - she hadn&rsquo;t slept much. of course, she always looked more washed out than other people, but it&rsquo;s been getting rather extreme as of late.</p>
<p>so, when you led her to the secret spot, she was surprised to find a small blanket there, and some fruit, too.</p>
<p>you took mental notes to thank lyney and lynette properly later, as it was them who swiftly did this just this morning. however, the fruit seemed fresh, and there were still some droplets; perhaps from they were washed, so it must have been what? 45 minutes, not more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what exactly is this?&rdquo; she asked as she observed the place. the blanket was neatly placed in front of the rainbow roses, the basket in the middle of it all. some stones were placed on all four corners of the blanket, so the wind wouldn&rsquo;t carry it away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been doing a lot for me, so i thought i could help you unwind a bit. or, you know, talk without anyone being near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the children showed you this spot, i presume? or a secret &lsquo;pen-pal&rsquo; you didn&rsquo;t tell me about?&rdquo; she asked, approaching the small picnic space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;nope, &lsquo;t was the childrens doing. i will thank them properly, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>she nodded and sat down, her hands feeling the softness of the blanket underneath you. you followed shortly after.</p>
<p>&ldquo;do as you wish, but the children already appreciate you. i doubt you need to do much more to earn their approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you think so?&rdquo; you asked her, lying back, settling on the blanket with your entire body. you felt the day washing over you, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;indeed so. they adore you, from what i can see. i have rarely seen them so eager to interact with someone. the last person who elicited this reaction out of them was the traveler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>you raised a brow and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the one with his flying fairy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>she nodded, gazing out at the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;paimon, yes indeed. they are an exceptional duo, and the children admire them greatly. but alas, they have to continue their journey. i&rsquo;m sure a constant such as you gives them more security than those two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>you laughed softly. &ldquo;you&rsquo;re quite the smoothtalker today, arle.&rdquo; you said, the nickname you had only ever used in your head slipping out, seemingly by accident. but this was you we&rsquo;re talking about; you rarely do accidents, and not in such situations either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;arle, huh?&rdquo; she asked, and unamused huff leaving her mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;perrie?&rdquo; you asked her teasingly in return. she sighed, and against all expectations, looked at you. her eyes seemed a little wearier than before, and she, for once, embraced the little smile on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that rather fits in the moment, i suppose.&rdquo; she said, and your heart skipped at beat. you looked at her, shock engraved in your eyes - the positive kind, the one that makes your stomach tighten and loosen again, before flooding it with warmth, comfort. the kind that sets your heart aflutter, that makes your head spin if you indulge long enough.</p>
<p>and yet, all you can do to properly reply was smile. warmer, than ever before.</p>
<p>there was a silence between you both like never before. it was comfortable, but so much warmer than you were able to recall. you just looked at each other, the starry sky above shining down on you. and for once you could see how this usually strict and stoic woman finally let her guard down, revealing the hurting child beneath. and yet, even that version of her was strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the first time my curse got to me was also the first time clervie and i properly met.&rdquo; she said softly, averting her gaze and looking up into the sky. she had mentioned a thing or two about their first interaction, and learning how it unfolded? priceless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that day, i buried my dead pet. a spider i named bambi. as i held her small makeshift coffin, my fingers began to burn. i figured such a thing would happen eventually, as i have been feeling this special kind of fire from the moment i have opened my eyes for the first time. but even so, i couldn&rsquo;t focus on that fact, tragic it may be. all i thought about was my pet in this box, and how much losing her hurt me to my core. clervie was a welcome distraction at the time. she brought me cake. the rest is a story i have told you already.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>you look at her as she talks, analyzing every inch of her body. her sitting there, so seemingly careless, and yet how she sat upright still radiated some kind of dominance, a facade that was hard to let go off - or so you could imagine.</p>
<p>subconsciously, your hand wandered a little more towards hers, the black and silver and red a beautiful contrast to the soft blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;would you want a pet spider again?&rdquo; you asked, showing no aversion to anything in that direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;maybe someday.&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;the children gifted me a lizard for my birthday one year. the longer it was in my custody, the bigger its desire grew to leave and see the world for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;oh, it escaped?&rdquo; you asked, wondering how the children must have felt-</p>
<p>&ldquo;i set it free.&rdquo; your eyes widened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what? why?&rdquo; you asked. confusion overcame you, as well as a repressed desire to simply laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it yearned for freedom. who am i to deny such a being its most important wish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>you bit your lip, a dry chuckle coming out as you tried to contain the laughfest within. your hand tightened its grip on the blanket and you looked away, not being able to look at her without breaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re laughing? what&rsquo;s so funny?&rdquo; she asked, oblivious as ever. perhaps even a little angered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;nothing, really.&rdquo; you said, taking deep breaths which would most likely result in hiccups later on. &ldquo;i just think you&rsquo;re taking such things a bit too literally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>as you looked at her again, you saw a spark in her red eyes. your beloved x&rsquo;s, slightly dilated as you had never seen them before. a vulnerability shaped by pure lightheartedness; you wonder how long it&rsquo;s been since she has talked to someone like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>what you also knew is that you have a chance now, however risky it might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you really do believe so? i see-&rdquo; she started, but you interrupted her swiftly, not wanting this moment to go to waste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that makes me wonder; if i were to ask you to, well, let&rsquo;s say kiss me? would you do that immediately or ask me a million times beforehand? if we go by your lizard logic, you&rsquo;d make my utmost wish come true as well, right?&rdquo; you said, a smirk on your face, and yet an immense blush covering your cheeks and the bridge of your nose.</p>
<p>her mouth opened slightly, then closed again. she looked away, a shy display of that usually strong woman you know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;how come you would use such a thing to test me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m not testing you, i&rsquo;m merely finding myself to be a little curious.&rdquo; you respond. you knew she wouldn&rsquo;t do much - her honor and respect kept her at bay, and maybe something deeper. perhaps a self doubt here, some worth-issues there. whatever it was that plagued her so, you wanted to find out. and if you didn&rsquo;t seize the opportunity now, when would you get another chance?&nbsp;</p>
<p>as of right now, your time was limited still. although you would like to change that in the future, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;curious about?&rdquo; she asked, and you scooted towards her just a little, your fingertips grazing her nails softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what you might do if i were to ask you such an intimate thing. i know it&rsquo;s been some time for you after all. i know you don&rsquo;t allow yourself such indulgence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>she chuckled quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;knowing me well, i see.&rdquo; she said and looked at you again. &ldquo;well, in such a case, what would you want me to do? what is it you desire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>you nodded, leaning closer towards her, your shoulders almost touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you heard me, did you not? kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;is that purely a test for your enjoyment?&rdquo; she asked, trying to seem nonchalant about it, but you saw the hurt in her eyes. her soul laid bare, something deep withing - not a craving, but a wish. a loneliness, perhaps. unfulfilled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;no.&rdquo; you said earnestly, all the teasing leaving you right this instant. &ldquo;i&rsquo;ve found myself wanting that for some time now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>she nodded. her fingers moved, some of them carefully grazing over yours near her. feeling you, your warmth. you&rsquo;re real, no shadow of her past. you were no responsibility, no duty. you were, well, just you.</p>
<p>and maybe it was enough. at least just this once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m glad the feeling is mutual.&rdquo; she said and turned towards you, leaning in, one hand grazing your fingers, the other coming up to cup your cheek so incredibly soft, it makes your heart bleed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;may i?&rdquo; she asked, and it knocked the breath out of your lungs. you swallowed, trying to piece together a cheeky response, but nothing came out. so instead, you leaned in, meeting her lips with your own in a slow motion.</p>
<p>her hand began to slowly settle on your cheek, you could feel her rather cold rings on your face, leaned into it softly as your hand came up and softly wrapped around her wrist, holding her there because you <em>just knew </em>she would pull away. and you wanted anything but that.</p>
<p>you moved against her slowly, the waves softly crashing against the shore in the background, some crickets breaking the freeing silence. for once, the world felt at peace, as her lips worked against your own with a care you had seldom witnessed. it was as if she held something precious in her hands, caressing it with utmost fragility, and kissing it as if she herself would die if it breaks. maybe she wouldn&rsquo;t, but you surely would if she were to break the embrace you found yourself in.</p>
<p>despite its unmatched beauty, the slight clumsiness of it all, your lips meeting at a pace that felt like time itself stopped; you two were humans after all. and regretfully so, humans had to breathe.</p>
<p>as you parted, you opened your eyes. her lips were slightly swollen, slightly redder than usual. both of you were breathing heavily, and as you looked up into her eyes - it was then when you noticed that her entire body was trembling ever so softly.</p>
<p>you swallowed again, your heart exploding, your throat feeling tight. this was more than anything you have ever experienced.</p>
<p>she, however, smiled. looked down onto your hands, her fingers tightening softly around yours as she held them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is this an opportune moment for me to tell you that it hasn&rsquo;t quite been &lsquo;some time&rsquo;, but rather, well, never before?&rdquo; she whispered, the confession hanging in the air for a mere second before you squeeze her hand affirmatively.</p>
<p>your mind short circuited. and you desperately searched for any kind of joke within her eyes. but there was none. either, you lost the ability to read her entirely, or-</p>
<p>&ldquo;i was your first kiss?&rdquo; you asked, trying to conceal the shock with something more positive, less judgemental, hoping it would come across as such.</p>
<p>she nodded. not a single word left her throat afterwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you realized that behind that facade of &lsquo;father&rsquo;, &lsquo;the knave&rsquo;, and whatever she was to other people, was still a woman wounded by fate, tricked into this wicked game between two worlds. and yet, mere human connection was something she craved, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you leaned in again, cupping her cheek this time. she was warm, the heat nothing out of the ordinary. unlike you, she didn&rsquo;t lean into you, but still closed her eyes regardless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;would you want to make this a second?&rdquo; you asked, a smile on your face at the clumsy attempt of flirting. but you couldn&rsquo;t help it - in a moment like this, when the time stops, how is your brain supposed to work properly?&nbsp;</p>
<p>she, too, smiled. for real. was that a first? you don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>all you remember was feeling her lips against yours for a second time tonight.</p>
<p>and hopefully, the second of many.</p>
