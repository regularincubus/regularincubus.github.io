        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;she came in, again?!&rdquo; the young barkeeper asked in a high pitched voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she was finishing up for the day when you entered the bar, out of breath and a single droplet of sweat threatening to form. yet it didn&rsquo;t - you don&rsquo;t sweat, and you&rsquo;re grateful for it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you told her the whole story - about a fatui official drinking at your bar, her rather hypocritical small talk; how her &lsquo;children&rsquo; watched you from afar. how she didn&rsquo;t stay for long, gave you a generous pay while telling you how she would remember your name.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;yes.&rdquo; you said, burying your head in your crossed arms. &ldquo;ordered some wine again. it was horrible.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">diona put down a glass in front of you - a mixture of sweet flower and dandelion seeds, brewed in a tea along with some silk flower from liyue that was purchased personally by the young lady herself. she brewed you some once when you couldn&rsquo;t properly walk anymore after an especially treacherous voyage from dornman port to the city of mondstadt.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;what are you waiting for? tell. me. more! i am dying to know!&rdquo; she exclaimed and sat down next to you. you huffed.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;she came in without her subordinates.&rdquo; you began.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa&rdquo; her voice spoke softly as she opened the door. you had just opened up; the coffee machine was brewing its first pot of the day - a special offer, most popular at around midday, when the construction workers were on break and the majority of the ship cast anchor at the port.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh, hello again.&rdquo; you said in a casual, polite tone. &ldquo;and a good morning, too!&rdquo; you added, the cordiality of it was part of your everyday demeanour. which is probably why so many people trusted and liked you so much. usually waiters and barkeepers can be rather&hellip; hard to keep up with, at least.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;d like to take a wine again, if you serve it at this hour.&rdquo; she said calmly as she walked towards your bar. the door behind her stayed closed, no one following her. you thought it was odd, but lastly, it was none of your business. you turned around, opened the wine again. same bottle as last night - barely anyone came her for something as fancy as fermented fruit. most people sought either the cheap beer, or the strong shots that made them happy. or maybe forget. it depended on the person.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i didn&rsquo;t expect you to be working a morning shift.&rdquo; she said as she folded her hands on the table, resting her head on them. no one else was here, except for the both of you, and you felt unease arise deep within.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">just treat her normally. treat her like everyone else. she doesn&rsquo;t seem like someone who enjoys the misery of others, so she won&rsquo;t hurt you. you hoped so, at least.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the cork popped. you poured her some.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m traveling tonight.&rdquo; you said as you put her glass down in front of her. &ldquo;to mondstadt. what about you? staying in dornman port for long?&rdquo; you tried to converse with her. with no one else around, there certainly wasn&rsquo;t much to do anyway. no distractions, either; so superficial conversation would have to suffice.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">besides, she seemed nice, despite everything.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;ah, i will be staying here just a while longer. then, i&rsquo;m expected to be back in fontaine in a few weeks. there are various of negotiations that have yet to take place. i&rsquo;ll assume the trip to mondstadt will not be final? a waiter such as yourself would be greatly missed, especially in this establishment.&rdquo; she says. you took a mental note.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">she talks a lot. not that you&rsquo;re complaining.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;ll return in a few days. i&rsquo;m just visiting my mother.&rdquo; you say with a smile.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;a visit to your mother? that sounds lovely; i am sure she will greatly appreciate it.&rdquo; she spoke softly, closing her eyes. she brought the glass up to her mouth, moving it back and forth. &ldquo;i, too, should do that, perhaps. maybe after my business in fontaine is done for.&rdquo; she says and smiles again before taking a sip.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you stay like this for a while, readying the coffee as the woman just sat there and drank her wine - though much slower than the previous night. perhaps she couldn&rsquo;t take much? perhaps it was still too early? who knows.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i cannot help but wonder if you were born here? perhaps even in mondstadt? i find myself to be quite curious.&rdquo; she says as she gazes out the window from afar, into the far north.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i was born in mondstadt, but i&rsquo;ve been living here for some time now. my grandmother lives here, too.&rdquo; you said. so many of your friends would&rsquo;ve slapped you in the face by now, revealing such information to a fatui official nonetheless. but you weren&rsquo;t known for being secretive of such things.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i see. i can imagine this must have been a lot of travelling for you?&rdquo; she says and takes another sip of wine.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;quite a lot, yes.&rdquo; you respond plainly. you look at her, truly, really look at her. she&rsquo;s wearing the same things as yesterday. her hair, her rings, everything seems to be perfectly in place. her hair was tied the same way, her nails looked the same, just like the slight hints of eye makeup. you wonder if she was just that good at keeping an outright appearance, or if something else was the reason behind her neatless appearance.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i have been to many establishments like this in my life, yet never had i encountered a waiter, who would not not treat themselves to a glass or cup of their own.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t usually do such things.&rdquo; you say, thinking back of the few occasions you did participate in raising a toast to someone or something.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;how come?&rdquo; she asks and looks at you. you peek at her wine glass - almost entirely full, still.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i usually don&rsquo;t drink. besides, i do suffer from anxiety regarding social interactions, and i also don&rsquo;t like alcohol, nor do i like getting drunk.&rdquo; you say, still trying to sound lighthearted. people usually either reacted with pity, confusion, or straight up ignored whenever you brought up your condition. and that was just the mental aspect, and only a part of it, too.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh? anxiety, you say. hm.&rdquo; she says and you can see her retreating for a second. &ldquo;i have heard of such cases, and have encountered some nonetheless. as the father of many children, it is unthinkable to not have someone suffer from the same fate as you, so i can imagine how difficult it must be. however, working in such a rather social field is very&hellip; powerful, to say the least.&rdquo; she smiles and takes another sip.</span></em></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;okay, hold on, let me guess, this is when you started to think she is interesting?&rdquo; diona throws a shit-eating grin at you and you cursed yourself for bothering a thirteen year old with a small crush of yours.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;maybe.&rdquo; you said and looked at her. she kept on grinning as she discarded of a dirty sponge. &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look at me like that.&rdquo; you say and almost chuckle.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;like what?&rdquo; diona says and comes closer. she sits down again, finally visibly relaxing, and opens a can of tuna. the one she kept hidden away from everyone, for emergencies. &ldquo;like i&rsquo;m right if i say you like her?&rdquo; she laughs and puts a big spoonful of the tuna into her mouth. moments like this really made her appear much younger than she was, and despite everything she went through, she was still a child at heart, you were glad.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t like her.&rdquo; you say, feeling a tug inside your heart at that, wondering </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">where the actual hell </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">that came from.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you do! i can prove it!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;because when you were telling me about all this, your eyes had this tiny bit of life in them.&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;are you calling my eyes dead?&rdquo;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;maybe. wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, you can be grumpy at times.&rdquo; she chuckles.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;says the baby enjoying her baby food with her little comfort spoon.&rdquo; you raise a brow, knowing you won this. diona looked at you with wide eyes, pushing the spoon so deep into the can of tuna, it disappeared half-way.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a spoon! that i-&rdquo; she paused. &ldquo;-that i happened to grab! and that&rsquo;s not baby food, that&rsquo;s my fish. and i won&rsquo;t share it with you now.&rdquo; she says and turns away from you, pouting as she does so. you smile and hold back a laugh.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">diona had always felt like a little sister to you. from a young age on, you wanted to care for her and take her under your wing; which made working on cocktails and flavours with her all the more fun. for some reason, she was an absolute genius when it came to mixology from the very second she came into contact with a shaker. everything she made was heavenly and utterly delicious.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;do what you want.&rdquo; you say and open your backpack. you came straight to the cats tail after arriving in mondstadt - didn&rsquo;t even unpack your stuff at your mother&rsquo;s place.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for some reason the desire to keep diona up-to-date was overwhelming today, even more so than ever. why, you didn&rsquo;t know. just like you didn&rsquo;t know why this woman just couldn&rsquo;t leave your head. her entire demeanour, the way she talks, with all the breaks and breathing - there was something to it that captivated you, you just couldn&rsquo;t put a label on it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you unpacked the plush doll you got her, as well as some ingredients. plants and fruit that can only be found around the port. those big blue eyes lit up, especially when white hand grasped the soft fabric of the saurian. she immediately put it to her chest, cuddling against it, murmuring how much bubbles will like its new friend, and you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile. buying stuff for people was always a pleasure and a treasure. you loved to give, especially to those closest to you.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the fact that this was mixed with childish excitement of your unofficial little sister made it ten times better.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she held it up to her ear, nameless as it was, and then looked at you.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it told me something.&rdquo; she said softly.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;oh? what did it say?&rdquo; you asked, leaning forward.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;that you&rsquo;re crushing on a fatui person.&rdquo; she laughed at placed the plush softly&nbsp; on the table in front of her. you leaned back, pinching the bridge of your nose metaphorically.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you tend to forget what a pain diona can be. lovingly, of course.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the topic changed quickly, however. and since it was late already, you didn&rsquo;t talk for long anyways. you walked her home after talking a bit about her past weeks, weird customers and her upcoming trip to inazuma. nothing special, nothing out of the ordinary. all the while dionas newest friend, lapras, as she called it, was listening diligently.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you hugged her as she stepped inside her home and made your way home, too. it wasn&rsquo;t far, after all, and you were looking forward to your cozy bed. though you&rsquo;re sure your encounter with the fatui lady would not leave your mind for the next few days. especially now that she gave you a name.</span></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; she said softly and stood up from her seat.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;yes?&rdquo; you say in return and watch her as she puts yet another small sack of mora on the table.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;keep the rest, see it as a little tip for excellent customer service.&rdquo; she smiles at you and turns around. your mind was working over time. you did not want to miss this chance, so-</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;my boss will ask about this. so, in case she asks, who gave me such a generous tip?&rdquo; you ask, your voice dying at the end. you felt like trying out those cheap pick-up lines the recruits of the knights of favonius would use on you regularly.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">the woman turned around and smiled again.</span></em></p>
        <p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;arlecchino.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;fourth of the fatui harbingers.&rdquo;</span></em></p>
