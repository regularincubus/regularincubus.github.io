  <h1>Chapter Seven</h1>
  <p>
  <p>&ldquo;and here i thought we could spend some time in the safe confines of this fine establishment, you know, just
    the two of us, of course.&rdquo; she says and steps inside. you&rsquo;re practically frozen in place at this point,
    one word away from being reduced to a sheer puddle underneath the counter - nothing more than what a typical busy
    night at the bar brought you.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; you say calmly and get up, deciding to put your duties aside for however long she
    didn&rsquo;t need anything related to it. she seemed amused, to see you come up so quickly; and knowing her, at
    least from the few words you exchanged, she knew exactly you were far from done. &ldquo;i did not expect you
    here.&rdquo; you added quickly.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;ah. i suppose you heard about the happenings in fontaine?&rdquo; she said and stepped even closer, coming to
    a stop in front of you at the other end of the counter. you didn&rsquo;t know if it was a good or bad thing that the
    thick wood separated the both of you; especially because the parts of you that wanted to disappear right then and
    there were at war with those that desperately wanted to cling onto her and never let go.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i did, yes.&rdquo; </span><em>and i have been researching them like a maniac</span></em>.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;good. then let me assume that you have certain questions regarding the matter? a bird or two might have told
    me about your frantic search for answers. it truly is a pity this beautiful port is so excluded from the events
    outside of mondstadt, yet every wonderful thing needs to have its perks, right?&rdquo; she said with a smile. you
    swallowed thickly, never once averting your gaze even for just a second. you couldn&rsquo;t, something pulled you
    towards her.</span></p>
  <p>and the worst thing about this is that you let her.</span></p>
  <p>she sat down gracefully, awaiting your response. judging from the looks of it all, it was just another day for her.
    her posture, her aura; it had all stayed the same ever since she last visited. not that it was a bad thing, but you
    were amazed just at how stable she was. truly admirable, and rare to find nowadays, too.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;to say i don&rsquo;t need any answers would be an understatement.&rdquo; you begin. &ldquo;i have looked
    into a few things, trying to find out what exactly happened. even reached out to a friend whom i thought could have
    been in fontaine when the flood hit. but to no avail.&rdquo; you confessed, one of your hands coming up to trace the
    soft edge of the counter. you followed your movement with your eyes, not missing the chuckle she let out.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i must say, you are just as sharp as i had expected. yet, to my surprise, you dove even deeper into the
    matters than i originally anticipated. quite admirable, to be interested in such affairs, although they affect you
    not.&rdquo; she says and looks up at you. her hands link in front of her, resting on the counter
    daringly.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>this woman was a masterpiece of composed grace; trained in the arts of communication, just as one would expect from
    a diplomat. and that made it all the more harder for you to distinguish between sincerity and facade when it came to
    her expressions, to her choice of words.</span></p>
  <p>just as you had seemingly aimlessly searched for answers, she, too, had come back. what the goal was, you
    couldn&rsquo;t even begin to imagine. you were nothing special, just a barkeeper getting by, living a life as
    ordinary as can be; and yet you kept on forgetting one crucial detail.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;so, what are you waiting for? i will respond to everything with utmost honesty, given i have and can provide
    answers for you.&rdquo; she says and smiles. naturally, to quench your thirst of knowledge, you would need to ask
    her just what happened in fontaine, but in the end this is something you could learn from every newspaper given some
    time passes. so instead-</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;what brings you back here? to dornman port, i mean?&rdquo; you ask, not having any expectations, really.
    perhaps a nice thing or two, perhaps some flattery. but no matter what, you wanted to hear her voice; and hopefully,
    she lived up to her claim.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;to be precise; you.&rdquo; she said plainly and your stomach dropped. you immediately look at her, eyes wide
    in confusion and happiness alike. a hint of concern, too.</span></p>
  <p>at the end of the day; this was not just a pretty woman looking after you. this was number four of the fatui
    harbingers. looking for you. you.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;how come?&rdquo; you asked, calmly, your face perhaps betraying your quiet aura, but who could blame you for
    such a thing. &ldquo;why me, exactly?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>she averts her gaze again, turning her head slightly as if to see if there is no one else with you. your heart
    picked up the pace.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;to be precise, i am intrigued by your heritage. i was sent to dornman port to investigate a
    khaenri&rsquo;ahn whose body withstands a certain condition. let&rsquo;s just call it a curse.&rdquo; she explained
    and looked at you. &ldquo;would you happen to know anything, of that sort?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>a smile like no other; daring, and yet it held a certain sincerity in its very core. whatever games she played, she
    was damn good at it.</span></p>
  <p>and that did wonders to your gracious and kind heart, that was very much attracted to her.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;my parents are from khaenri&rsquo;ah, yes.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s about all i
    know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;do you have any information about the whereabouts of your father? i recall you telling me your mother
    resided and worked in mondstadt, correct?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>you looked at her, contemplating as to how to proceed. which way would be safest.</span></p>
  <p>the problem of it all? you felt safe with her regardless. a strange sensation, feeling like this with a stranger,
    yet while your heart thirsted for more proximity between you, your rather rational gut signaled you that this woman
    was to be trusted.</span></p>
  <p>all the while your head screamed at you to at least question that.</span></p>
  <p>but what do they say? always trust your gut feeling.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;he got imprisoned a few years ago. for theft.&rdquo; you explain. &ldquo;at least that&rsquo;s what i know.
    he is in the fortress of meropide.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;the fortress&hellip;&rdquo; she murmured and hummed. &ldquo;perhaps my investigation wasn&rsquo;t thorough
    enough.&rdquo; she said, leaving you with nothing but questions piling up. and yet, despite the tension in your
    body, you asked; massive amounts of long accumulated bravery leaving your body at once.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;why do you want to know all this?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>she sighs, yet the faint smile quickly returns to her face.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;let us call it a personal matter.&rdquo; she says, looking out of the window far away. &ldquo;there are some
    things i need to investigate that are not in direct correlation to official business of neither the fatui, nor the
    house of the hearth. i do hope you understand my want for privacy in that regard. not even my children know the full
    extent of that matter, and i would prefer to keep it that way.&rdquo; she says and turns back to you. &ldquo;do you
    have any more information on your origin? your birth place, even?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>you think for a second, desperately trying to process it all, and desperately failing at the same time. you take a
    deep breath, realizing that no matter what, you already dug yourself into a deep hole and there was no real escape
    from it, now.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i was born in mondstadt. as for my parents, they grew up in dornman port and mondstadt respectively,
    although one of my grandmothers moved to sumeru some time ago.&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>she nodded, taking in what you said in great detail.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i see. hm, grandparents.&rdquo; she was brooding, and you could see how she was thinking, how her brain was
    working.</span></p>
  <p>you damned yourself internally for finding the thought of that cute.</span></p>
  <p>as she was sitting there, pondering about how to proceed since the answers you provided her did not seem to
    properly satisfy her, you already came up with an idea. an idea so stupid, every single person would slap you for it
    - even blame you for a stupidity you have not displayed in all your life.</span></p>
  <p>you were cool, calculated, stoic for most. and yet, despite your stable life waiting for you, despite your
    organized routine and increasing mental health, you seriously wanted to ask her if you could help her investigate -
    if there was more you could do.</span></p>
  <p>you still had your grandmothers to ask for things, your mother too. the library of mondstadt surely offered many
    possibilities, too, and perhaps diona could help you out in that regard as well without getting involved
    directly.</span></p>
  <p>thinking about mingling with fatui was bad enough. much worse, a harbinger. probably also much worse, someone with
    black arms and red crosses for eyes, yet seldom had something felt so right, and your heart hadn&rsquo;t beaten like
    that in a long time, either.</span></p>
  <p>fact aside that you would give up parts of your relaxed life; but was doing something you enjoy really so bad?
    especially if it was of use for someone. of course you would not want to accidentally help the fatui to do ill, yet
    something about the entire situation; her coming here, her slowly trying to get close to you, her lowering her
    guard, felt strangely familiar. as if it has to be like this, as if this makes you happy and you finally found
    something you lost. perhaps it was your imagination, or perhaps you hallucinated from being hit by a barrel earlier
    and the entire conversation is just a made up product in your head. but you trust her. trust her that she
    doesn&rsquo;t have any ill intentions with seeking out this knowledge.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i could ask around some more, see what i can gather.&rdquo; you offer nonchalantly. she looks at you, half
    amused, half intrigued.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;you would be willing to do such a thing?&rdquo; she asks, an eyebrow quirked. you merely shrugged.</span>
  </p>
  <p>&ldquo;sure. i don&rsquo;t see any issues with it. depending on how long you stay in dornman port, i&rsquo;m sure i
    could provide you with something, even if it&rsquo;s not much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>she nods in approval. &ldquo;i need you to know that doing such business with a fatui official can have a negative
    impact on your reputation. some of my children are met with the same fate of being excluded and looked down upon for
    their status. are you sure, you would want to cooperate under such circumstances?&rdquo;</span></p>
  <p>of course you&rsquo;re aware. yet it&rsquo;s kind of her to elaborate again. what she didn&rsquo;t know, however;
    once you set your mind on something, you won&rsquo;t be able to let go until it&rsquo;s finished.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>and this was one of those things.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;i don&rsquo;t have any issues with it.&rdquo; you say casually. &ldquo;i have nothing researching and i
    enjoy gaining the knowledge, so i do not have a problem with people potentially looking down on me. lots of people
    have been doing that for all my life, but mostly because they were too intimidated.&rdquo; it was in that moment
    that you knew you struck a nerve with her.</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;intimidated, you say? i&rsquo;m looking forward to that.&rdquo; she smiles. &ldquo;the compensation for your
    efforts will of course be generous. thank you.&rdquo; she says with a nod.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;now, could you pour me a beverage of your choice? i trust your appraisal of my character.&rdquo; she speaks
    and you return a slight smile. &ldquo;after all, someone as intimidating as you surely knows their way around
    people, and perhaps even a person such as myself?&rdquo;</span></p>
