    <h1>College AU </h1>
    <p>&ldquo;get in there, come on!&rdquo; she nearly yelled, the booze and lack of air only adding to her already
      energetic nature. navia surely was a wild one, hence why she hosted this whole ordeal in the first place.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a house party at the caspar residence; one of the most pompous houses in the entire town. what could possibly go
      wrong?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and the worst part? you were there. and only god knows why you let yourself get dragged into this mess by none
      other than chasca herself. however she came up with that after furiously making out with you on the couch.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>but that was the so-called &lsquo;peacemaker&rsquo; for you; always trying to ensure that even the most secluded
      people fit in. that&rsquo;s what her reputation was about, after all.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>with a groan, you let yourself be pushed in the closet. for some reason (mavuika), the whole house decided to
      play seven minutes in heaven. and navia, being a spoiled girl, had more than enough closets and rooms for at least
      five, if not six couples. excluding the second floor and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and for another unknown reason (xilonen, mavuikas &lsquo;fling&rsquo;), even the most reserved people had to
      participate in that. so, naturally, you were less than thrilled when charlotte read your name and did nothing but
      smiled at you with a huge smirk on her face. you didn&rsquo;t even fully realize who was about to join you, too
      busy contemplating on how fast you could run home after getting out of the closet without passing out half-way.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the door opened, and you already prepared for the worst. the best case would be skirk, obviously, but you
      haven&rsquo;t seen her since she left you to get a drink an hour ago. after that came probably mualani, or maybe
      even sethos, given they assigned men to you. you were sure almost everyone knew about your sexuality, but knowing
      the very, very, very powerful and giddy host of this party, she wouldn&rsquo;t want to pass upon opportunities
      like this to have some new friendships form along the way, too.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>yet, who sat down in front of you was none other than arlecchino. you had seen her a few times on campus, always
      around this group of eleven other people, one more noble and extra looking than the other. you only knew of
      tartaglia who belonged to them; having been skirks pupil from a very early age on, you and him saw each other a
      lot whenever you decided to visit her. and he talks. a lot, at that.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m sorry for getting thrown into this mess. i originally didn&rsquo;t plan on participating.&rdquo;
      she says with a slight apologetic smile. you both sit on the ground, and its less than surprising that she pulls
      one of her legs to her chest and rests her head atop it. &ldquo;let&rsquo;s just wait it out? i think that would
      be most comfortable for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you can&rsquo;t help but nod at that, awkwardly that is. oh, and stare at her, too.</p>
    <p>she wore a red blouse, black, tight pants. heels, which seemed a bit too regal for a mere college party. some
      chains here and there, and if you squinted you could see a delicate black choker around her neck.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>she was beyond stunning.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay.&rdquo; you said, your mouth moving faster than your brain could process. &ldquo;i
      don&rsquo;t mind being stuck if it&rsquo;s with you. could&rsquo;ve been much worse.&rdquo; you blabbered out and
      your heart came to a stop a few seconds later, when two red crosses already stared at you, and a small chuckle
      escaped from her lips.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i couldn&rsquo;t agree more. i find your company to be rather pleasant, too. just imagine to be stuck with
      a blue-haired science student, who smells like nothing but ammonia and cheap perfume to conceal it.&rdquo; she
      laughs and lifts her head. she looks at you properly now and you can see slightly flushed cheeks. perhaps she had
      some punch earlier, just like the rest of the huge party.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and while you didn&rsquo;t enjoy people who drank, you couldn&rsquo;t blame anyone for enjoying some punch. after
      all, escoffier was a genius in the public eye.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and while you agreed, you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile at the thought of being one of the few people who knew
      that the punch was created by none other than the girl escoffier tutors: a young teenager called diona.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i have seen you around before. allow me to ask you: what&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; she asks you and you
      can feel your cheeks heating up slightly.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; you say, and almost immediately add- &ldquo;first year acting student.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>arlecchino nods. &ldquo;acting is such a lovely craft. i can&rsquo;t wait to see you on stage or at the big
      screen someday, so that i can proudly say: i was stuck in a closet with this person on a party once!&rdquo;&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and for some reason, you chuckled at that cheap, clumsy joke.</p>
