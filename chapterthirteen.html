    <h1>Chapter Thirteen </h1>
    <p>it was embarrassing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>having a dream like this, only to find yourself waking up with a thin layer of sweat coating your skin, and a wetness between your legs like you hadn&rsquo;t felt in quite some time. to say it&rsquo;s been a while would be unnecessary - you are not your father, and you can very well function without constantly thinking about sex.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>but still, just the thought of this mysterious woman eliciting such emotions and physical reactions from you was something you somewhat foresaw, yet did not really want to fully comprehend.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>she was a stranger</em>, you told yourself last night in a desperate attempt. for the last time, that is, until you realized that you travelled across half the world with said stranger with barely any second thought. you were done for, utterly wrecked, and not a single brain cell within you could properly understand why no one stopped you.</p>
    <p>or well, they did, you just blatantly ignored it, and now you find yourself horny for the woman at the end of the corridor, in a different nation, at night. and it&rsquo;s only come to you know that whatever happened over the past few weeks was so painfully unlike you, it made you sick, almost.</p>
    <p>and yet, just with so many things in life, you took a deep breath and rolled over onto your back. it was early in the morning, the sun was barely up, and you would have to get up soon for your first instance of training. with none other than her; which will be an absolute delight to experience.</p>
    <p>you stared at the ceiling as you thought about your vision and what you could possibly do with it. perhaps today you will learn some new things, although you weren&rsquo;t sure how exactly. in that regard, you were no hands-on person. you didn&rsquo;t even want your hands near a fight, to be entirely honest, so if arlecchino pulled out a scythe from who-knows-where, you would straight up just sit down and not get up anymore. learning that a scythe is also incredibly unsafe to use and harms oneself way more than one could possibly harm any enemies, was just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>perhaps reading about weaponry wasn&rsquo;t the brightest idea back then, or at least letting the knowledge stick, that was supposed to be used for bar smalltalk only. well, now you know what to throw out of your mind next time you find it hard to remember a certain thing.</p>
    <p>with an internal groan, you get up, throw on some clothes, trying to look presentable while learning how to fight. you already dreaded what she might put upon you, especially knowing that most physical stuff really wasn&rsquo;t your specialty. you were fast and always quick on your feet. it wasn&rsquo;t hard to catch up with customers, but except for the occasional walk, there was not much physical activity in your day to day life. surely training with her would exhaust you, physically and mentally, and while you were not looking forward to that, you very much anticipated seeing her fight, no matter how easy she was on you.</p>
    <p>with slow steps, as to not wake anyone else, you walked toward her room, leaving your own behind without locking the door. no one would steal anything anyway, and you weren&rsquo;t hiding anything after all.</p>
    <p>just before you could knock, she opened the door already. a slight smile crept up her face as she looked at you. &ldquo;good morning. i assume you are ready to leave?&rdquo; she asked and you nodded. &ldquo;sure. and good morning to you, too.&rdquo; you said, feeling a little hot as you properly took her in. seeing her like this and knowing what had happened just last night in your dream should be a forbidden craft.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;very well&rdquo; she said and exited her room. she locked the door behind her and put the key away neatly, before she started walking down the corridor in quiet steps. as you left the hotel, you could see a few children here and there. they were always on the rather older side. just as you walked through the main entrance, a tired lyney and a very exhausted lynette greeted you. of course, he took off his head as you two walked past, and you smiled at them warmly, wondering what they did all night to look so distraught. it&rsquo;s best to ask that later, you concluded quickly.</p>
    <p>you walked next to her in silence as you left the court and soon found yourself on a comfortable little training ground far away from any distractions, let alone people. you were perfectly secluded, just like you had asked her to.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;is this suitable? if not, i will arrange something else of course. wouldn&rsquo;t want my esteemed guest to feel uncomfortable under my wing.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you smirked at the way she talked, approached her even when she came to a stop.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;under your wing, huh?&rdquo; you asked. &ldquo;is this you implying that you&rsquo;re taking me in?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you stopped right in front of her, looking into her eyes. usually, you felt so small next to her, so remembering that you were on eye-level with her was more than a delight.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;perhaps i did, yet not in the way you would expect, or so i presume. i wouldn&rsquo;t want you as my child, if i&rsquo;m being honest, nor do you qualify for that&rdquo; she said with a slight grin. &ldquo;although, if you were to show interest in joining, i wouldn&rsquo;t object.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no, no, you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; you shrug. &ldquo;my parents are still very much alive, so i don&rsquo;t qualify to call you &lsquo;father&rsquo;, but i wasn&rsquo;t interested in that anyway.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re awfully bold today. had any good dreams?&rdquo; and a shiver ran down your spine. a cold one, and one that just so took a turn and went straight to your core at the memories from last night.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;more delightful than ever. i dreamt about you taking me under your wing, of sorts. funny, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>she chuckled and took a step closer to you, careful to not overstep your personal space, although she was the only person who may step into it unasked.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i suppose those dreams are the same reason you are in such high spirits today. savor it, and concentrate as we proceed. i do not intend on going easy on you.&rdquo; she said quietly, her hand coming up to rest on your shoulder. this may perhaps be the first time that such a touch sparked something within you, and it wanted to let you get swallowed whole by the ground, but jump at her and kiss her all the same.</p>
    <p>at closer thought, your internal struggle was a little amusing. terrifying, too, of course, but also strangely amusing to the point in which potential embarrassment has long left you. at least for now.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;every other person i know would&rsquo;ve asked what those dreams were about.&rdquo; you immediately throw back at her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;should you be glad i&rsquo;m not like those &lsquo;other people&rsquo; you refer to, or shall i take the risk and ask about what made your slumber so enjoyable? not to overstep anything, of course, but unless it has something to do with me, in which case i can only imagine what you might dream about, i fear i am not that interested in your dreams. at least not in this moment. perhaps a conversation at the dinner table will suffice? i had the children prepare a barbecue for tonight, with lyney and lynette organizing everything.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>that fact alone made you raise your suspicions. &ldquo;when did you tell them about it?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;last night, of course. there are no missions, so they will get sufficient rest. knowing that i will be busy with you the entire day, i couldn&rsquo;t have possibly taken any organization into my own hands. besides, lyney enjoys a beautiful reputation among the younger ones, so they will follow his lead in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you laughed as you averted your gaze from her, hoping the blush on your face wasn&rsquo;t all too prominent. you&rsquo;ve been told that you were prone to such a reaction multiple times; being made fun off, too. and yet, you had an awful feeling this woman was not one to let you go easy if she found out.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;looking forward to it.&rdquo; you said plainly and took a step back. surely you wanted her to notice you, but not like that. not like a flustered little mess, and as of right now, she has outsmarted you and you even changed the topic accidentally - a rare slip up, yet one that occurs whenever you&rsquo;re too attracted to someone.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you cursed your brain for making the dream so graphic. your body and mind could stop feeling like this at any second, of course, but why would you allow that? it&rsquo;s fun to mess with people, it&rsquo;d be fun to mess with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and after all, you can still turn this around.</p>
    <p>she took a step back from you and made her scythe appear right in her hand. it&rsquo;s impressive, truly, and you wondered for a brief second just how far you could push your own vision, but quickly let go of that thought. you were here on a mission. whatever it was exactly, but the main objective was getting under her skin.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;since you possess no knowledge of fighting, let me explain some things to you.&rdquo; she said and raised her scythe. she aimed it at you effortlessly, and it didn&rsquo;t take you long to come up with something.</p>
    <p>usually, you would have simple took a step forward and pushed your throat against it. such daring things are what made you you after all - always pushing forward, always brave and daring. and yet, knowing that such a big display of attention-seeking bravery wouldn&rsquo;t get you far just yet, you raised a delicate finger and traced the sharp edge of her weapon carefully.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo; she said, a dim expression on her face, but there was something else entirely. you couldn&rsquo;t put a finger on it just yet, but it was beyond her usual demeanour.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;just appreciating this. i suppose you made it yourself? with your vision, i mean?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>she lowers her scythe again. &ldquo;i yield a special kind of fire. one that is not entirely from this time.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;elaborate.&rdquo; you, now intrigued and absolutely not surprised at what a miserable fail that attempt was, took a step towards her again. you&rsquo;ve been here for some time now, yet all you did is walk around. honestly, if this, and some banter, was all the training would consist of, you&rsquo;d be a very happy person.</p>
    <p>she takes a deep breath. &ldquo;perhaps such things are better discussed elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you promised me there would be no one around, right?&rdquo; you said with a smirk. &ldquo;well then, arlecchino, there is no obstacle in the way. so, tell me about you. you know all about me after all, it&rsquo;d only be a fair trade.&rdquo;</p>
