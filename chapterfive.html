    <h1>Chapter Five</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it takes you four days until the first glimpses of doubt arise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">one more to get rid of that again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">then three more to realize that there is a slight possibility of her not even being in dornman port anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">ever since you returned, the bar has been loud, stressful - all the things one would expect from such an&nbsp; establishment, and yet you found it in your heart to hope that whenever you placed another polished glass on the shelf and turned around to serve the next guest, it would be her. and yet, every single one of your tries was met with disappointment. still, every day gave you more time to prepare for just when she will be back. and for once in your life, you allowed yourself to slightly daydream, too.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">she came in as per usual, one of the earlier guests in the nightly rush of things; sitting down, taking great care of her coat as she does so. she puts her hands on the counter in front of her, a content smile on her face. just before she can say something, you turn around again. &ldquo;the usual?&rdquo; you would say with a slight smile you don&rsquo;t give just anyone, radiating genuinity and the closest to warmth you can extend to a stranger.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you shake your head, averting your gaze from the empty space in front of you. usually, she would sit at the center of the bar, which also marks the center of the entire establishment, but that spot was currently taken by a construction worker who had just broken up with someone (though you suspect that he got broken up with instead). your most well-paying customer tonight, and the reason for your co-worker to fetch another barrel of beer from the basement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you look around, see an old couple leaving, and you quickly grab the supplies to clean the table they sat at. that was usually not your responsibility, but with everything going as turbulent as it was, you had some mercy tonight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">bucket in hand, you walked towards the small table and quickly began to wipe it clean, getting rid of the stains and crumbs of the night. some fell to the floor; the old sponge you used was not able to pick them all up.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">you could feel her presence behind you, felt her rather slender body pressing up against you. a sleek black hand made its way down your forearm, her fingers interlacing with yours as you cleaned the table. her breath hit your ear and goosebumps formed at the base of your neck.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;vanessa,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not a very efficient to clean, is it now?&rdquo; she whispers. you swallow and were just about to nod-</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;uhm, excuse me!&rdquo; a shrill voice said. it sounded nervous. you turned around and saw a woman fiddling with her hands. she wore a mask, a black coat with fur at the hood - a fatua. clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;yes?&rdquo; you asked in return, swinging the towel over your shoulder again. you gathered the supplies and approached the woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;is this.. table available?&rdquo; she asked, averting her gaze from you. you nod. &ldquo;yes, of course. i just finished cleaning up. please, take a seat, i will take your order shortly.&rdquo; you say in a cordial tone, trying to make her feel more comfortable. the woman nods and sits down quickly. you wipe the table once more with a dry cloth and leave her, your attention never wavering from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was not unusual to have other members of the fatui at the establishment; a common occurrence like no other, and you have seen all kinds of people. one of them even had something that looked like blood at his shoe once. you never questioned it; partly because it would have been rude to do so, but also because while you do not mind dying, you would prefer not to die in this bar by an angry man who stabbed you with this awful looking blunt knife he put on the table next to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you put the supplies away and return swiftly, a block and a pen in hand that serves more the purpose of avoiding questions than actually writing something down. but all the wanna-be smug old people coming in, complaining about how waiters from their time used to be oh so organized was something you did not want to deal with, and so you kept this old tradition up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">as you approached the table, you see another fatuus entering and quickly taking a seat next to the trembling woman. they talk, as quietly as one can be, and only stop when you&rsquo;re near.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you take their orders, a glass of water and a lemonade, and quickly prepare the beverages for them. although you can&rsquo;t stop yourself from listening in just slightly from afar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">words like &lsquo;mission&rsquo;, &lsquo;prophecy&rsquo; and &lsquo;fontaine&rsquo; all did not tell you much. and yet, one thing caught your ear, after you brought them their drinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;fontaine was met with a huge flood. the knave is dead.&rdquo; the woman nervously said. you wondered who this person might be, but quickly discarded the thought again. but just as you turned to leave-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;first they lost number eight and now number four.&rdquo; you heard and something within you dropped. you walked away, towards the bar, far away from their mumbles; far away from something that, somewhere in this universe, could be true. but it wasn&rsquo;t. you refused. and yet, when you were behind the counter, you felt helpless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you looked around, checking if there is something you could do near them, if there was a table or something to clean, someone needing new drinks. but there was nothing. you also could not just go up to a pair of fatui, asking what happened - this was not your business at all. and asking surely would only make you seem suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you kept your eyes on them, hoping to read something from their expressions, but the bar was full and your mind was clouded and you didn&rsquo;t even understand why this message affected you so much. yes, she was attractive, but that was about it? so why would you care, why would those news make your heart sink like that? why would that leave you trembling, barely able to function in the middle of a busy night?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;hey. you okay?&rdquo; a coworker asks you and you nod, throat tied shut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it couldn&rsquo;t be. but at the same time, you knew first hand how wrong some news could become if passed along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a small theft at liyue harbor turned into a huge robbery on the northland bank, a new small shop at the port was suddenly dominating the industry, and new research at the sumeru akademiya surmised that men have it worse after all; just because some sailors didn&rsquo;t have the care nor patience to listen properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">there was nothing you could do to soothe the ache deep within you. nothing to think about other than this mysterious woman. dead. drowned. not here anymore, not returning to the establishment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">something was off, and something within you kept convincing you that there was no way in hell this was true. that a few words of seemingly low-ranking fatui could not be trusted. and yet, you knew the gossip the fatui in mondstadt talked about, and from what you know, that always turned out to be correct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you swallowed thickly. a weird feeling in your stomach kept you from breaking down entirely. but still, the rest of the shift went by in a haze. you barely remember what you did, barely remember what you served or when the people who might have brought you the most heartbreaking truth in a long time left, or if they stayed until your shift was up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the walk home went by in a state of disbelief, trying to hold back tears, but lastly you broke down when you arrived home. careful to not wake anyone, you locked yourself away in the bathroom, crying as you held your plushie to your chest. you don&rsquo;t know how long this went on, when you went to bed and how long you even slept. you just remember waking up to your grandmother having prepared food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it was a rainy day. you didn&rsquo;t show up to work that day, knowing taking one day off for sick leave won&rsquo;t lead the bar into its doom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you avoided the newspaper your grandfather brought home. avoided everyone. went back to bed after eating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">no one asked. you used to have those days a lot before you started out at the bar, so it was nothing new to anyone.</span></p>
<p class="demoTitle"><span style="font-weight: 400;">yet this was not the typical dread you felt - this was a deep-rooted anxiety like no other. like a piece of you died alongside </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">her</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
