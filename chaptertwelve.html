    <h1>Chapter Twelve </h1>
    <p>the first week in fontaine went by in a whim. shortly after you arrived, you immediately made your way to the hotel bouffe d&rsquo;etes, the base of operations for the house of the hearth in fontaine. it was a beautiful scenery, two buildings connected by something akin to a small bridge and a big passageway underneath.</p>
    <p>that day, she assigned you a room that wasn&rsquo;t far from her own place to stay. it was safer and more organized, hence more professional that way if you were to sleep there instead of mingling with the smaller children on a different floor.</p>
    <p>to your delight, your room was equipped with a desk, two chairs, a small table and a bed; a window let you see the other building clearly, as well as the various shops this street had to offer. it was located at the end of the corridor, so as shielded and secluded as it could be. you enjoyed that simple fact, although you doubt there would be much trouble with the children. not that you had met many by now, of course.</p>
    <p>the streets were bustling, vibrant and lively to the core; one child beamed brighter than the next, and at first glance, you wouldn&rsquo;t believe that this is an orphanage, let alone belong to the fatui.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;father!&rdquo; she was greeted upon arrival. she had barely set foot on the stairs, when two people, seemingly your age and awfully looking-alike, welcomed you at the very doorstep of your new life.</em></p>
    <p><em>when you left the boat, she took you by hand. metaphorically speaking, of course; realistically, you suspected she would never do such a thing, not unless it was necessary. while your body was slowly recovering, you were not sick enough anymore to require her aid.</em></p>
    <p><em>what a pity, really.</em></p>
    <p><em>as you walked through the streets, you couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at just about every building, taking it in. it all seemed so huge, so modern and big. the clockwork mecha, gardemeks as they were called, roamed the streets freely, and it took you seeing three for you to get at least a little familiar with them.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>fontaine certainly was an interesting place. although you doubt you would see much of its life, anyway. not that you were complaining. you actually enjoyed being a little shut-in here and there, and with nothing to do outside of your room, you will be most delighted to indulge in that.</em></p>
    <p><em>you remember it clearly, your first impression. it&rsquo;s been a mere few days, but against all odds, it felt a bit more like home already. or maybe not home entirely, but a sanctuary - a safe nest for you.</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t expect you back so soon! oh, and you&rsquo;ve brought a guest, i see!&rdquo; the young man with the extraordinary head said. his hair was beige with a hint of pink in his bangs, and he wore thigh straps that helped fixating his stockings. a bold choice of clothing indeed, and yet, you adored that he seemed to be wearing what&rsquo;s comfortable for him.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;lyney, lynette, this is vanessa. they will assist me in some private matters.&rdquo; arlecchino responded, the faint smile from before all but faded completely.</em></p>
    <p>you had heard those names before; of course you did. how could you not? being the most famous magicians in fontaine, perhaps even in all of teyvat one day, if their reputation managed to uphold itself like that. it would be most pleasant, honestly. especially after having them being the ones who introduced you to everything.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;this is the area for the smaller kids. but the big table you see in the middle? this is where the magic happens!&rdquo; lyney said and chuckled, while lynette walked next to him, clearly unimpressed. &ldquo;father likes to hold regular barbecues, and this is just the perfect spatiality for such an occasion! see for yourself.&rdquo; he said and proceeded to show you around the huge living room. at least that&rsquo;s what it felt like, after all.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;please excuse my brother.&rdquo; lynette whispered to you just as lyney got side-tracked by one of his sibling who needed his urgent assistance in opening a very tightly sealed box of crayons for him. &ldquo;he can get a bit eccentric. only recently, a good friend of ours departed. i suppose he feels sad about it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>you nodded, and as your head continued to clear up, so did the ability to notice the little signs of unease you saw in him. and honestly? you would feel the same. being part of this organization seemed like big responsibility. and alrecchino seemed to trust him a lot, so perhaps he felt even more responsible for certain matters around the house? whatever it was, you were grateful his sister could always calm him back down to reality whenever he started radiating a little too much energy. perhaps she sensed somehow that this was a bit too much after such a voyage.</em></p>
    <p><em>and knowing the harbinger, that might have just been lynettes specialty to do. over time you learned that, despite common belief, she actually lets the younger woman do whatever she desired; and that made it possible for her to hone her observation skills to levels you could very well see yourself in. of course, you didn&rsquo;t know just how exactly lynette works her magic, nor were you in a position to judge it. but either way; it was impressive. and the sheer fact that arlecchino herself encouraged such things managed to shrink the tiny part of you, the part that was still doubting why you were even here in the first place, just by the slightest bit.</em></p>
    <p>there was this other child, who was a bit younger than lyney and lynette. he was a diver, reserved and, according to arlecchino, underestimated himself a lot. you haven&rsquo;t met him properly, as for he was busy with something beneath the sea, somewhere you would like to set foot on some time. perhaps freminet could take you with him at some point.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>whenever you saw him, you smiled and he tried to return it. his mechanical toy - no, his best friend - pers in hand, he steadily walked past you. not that you were complaining, but it warmed your heart in previously unspoken ways.</em></p>
    <p><em>you spent a lot of time alone, or with the children. getting to know them all, you also came across some, who adored lyney to no end - a young man, a boy and girl stood out in particular. chapleau, heloir and foltz, as you learned later on.they were a nice bunch, always ready to help with trying to get you comfortable, and you came to the realization that you have never received such hospitality from anyone before. this was heaven; having nice people around, who loved to talk and interact with you, yet who also left you alone if needed. the fights between them also stayed at a minimum during the week. it all seemed perfect.</em></p>
    <p>and yet, you have barely seen her at all since you arrived. for some reason, that was torturous for you, and also didn&rsquo;t help that you have barely done anything during this entire time. you&rsquo;re sure she wouldn&rsquo;t mind, at least not much, and yet-</p>
    <p>before you could even properly realize it, you were standing up and walking towards her room. it was evening already, but some of the children were stil working in the kitchen. you heard something about a traveller having taught a cooking class recently, so now they would try out what they had learned. very cute, actually.</p>
    <p>you knocked with a gentleness like no other to not startle her too much. you&rsquo;ve known her for some time now, so you supposed she wasn&rsquo;t asleep by now. you&rsquo;ve been with her for long enough to confidently say that her personal sleep schedule is way more messed up than yours ever was. and you found it funny how she could appear so composed, still.</p>
    <p>the door opens and she stands there, her jacket discarded somewhere, and she was even smaller than usual. you did, however, not check if she was barefoot or not. you wouldn&rsquo;t be like that. for now.</p>
    <p>her hair was down; her hair clip nowhere to be seen. she was stunningly beautiful - not that this was new information, but something was different in seeing her like this. perhaps it was because you were in her home, perhaps it was just a sacred act to catch a woman unwind in the evening.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;good evening. can i perhaps help you somehow?&rdquo; she said and you stared at her for a few more seconds before finally getting your brain to work again.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;yes, you can, actually. i- wanted to talk to you about the training lessons&rdquo; you said out of the blue. of course, you wanted them, but weren&rsquo;t as yearningful as you presented yourself to be.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;oh? i think this is a matter rather discussed tomorrow in the morning, don&rsquo;T you think? unless you would like to pursue them that soon already?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you nodded. &ldquo;i would very much like to pursue you&rdquo; you said, a slight smile on your face giving away just as much as you wanted her to perceive. &ldquo;unless you, of course, can&rsquo;t handle such a sudden switch up of plans?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you were sure that she wasn&rsquo;t stupid, that she knew that you felt more than just a bit of respect. however, you were not entirely sure what her smirk meant. it intrigued you regardless.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;oh, i&rsquo;ll be able to handle myself just fine. i rather find myself to be concerned about you, but if you approach me with such vigor, who am i to deny you of what you so desperately wish for?&rdquo; she asked, leaning against the door frame slightly. you nodded.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;i actually wanted to talk to you about something else&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;something rather, private?&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p><em>again, she nodded and motioned you to come in. it didn&rsquo;t take you many words to have her turn around for you, exposing her neck and the bare expanse of her back to you; you had never seen skin as smooth as this. it was a delight, really, and you needed to force yourself with all you had to peel your eyes off of it.</em></p>
    <p><em>you undid her garment swiftly, leaving her bare in front of you. instead of turing away, taking another shirt, another bra, just, something, out of her drawer; she turned around, looking at you with soft red crosses, the contour blurring into one another the longer she was gazing at you.</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;arlecchino&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;arle.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p><em>she took a step towards you, her bare front only breaths away from your own body. you felt everything within you heating up; a steady flame, and number four of the fatui harbingers was the one to ignite it.</em></p>
    <p><em>a black hand trailed up your arm; sharp nails scratched it with all the care and gentleness in the world. shivers ran down your spine and goosebumps made the hair on your arms stand up.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;careful, are you not? what is this?&rdquo; you said, a quiet chuckle. &ldquo;iif you keep going with this, i might as well let myself be pawned at by all those kid-&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>she interrupted you with a soft kiss. steady and slow, careful in their wake as she moved her lips against yours. &ldquo;speak like this again and i will banish you from my room in an instant&rdquo; she whispered against your lips and you laughed. &ldquo;i&rsquo;d like to see you try.&rdquo; you chuckle and this time, you lean in. this kiss was even more beautiful than before, and all the more passionate, too. there was something about having her in front of you, her two hands slowly sneaking their ways up your body, starting from your hip. one hand stays on your back, the other is cupping your cheek and her tongue swipes against your lips.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>it was intoxicating; perhaps this was the closest you had ever gotten to being high. but if she was your drug for the rest of your life, you wouldn't complain, nor miss a single daily dosage.</em></p>
    <p><em>she pulled you inside, closed the door and pressed you against it a bit too harshly. the heavy thump that echoes through your head left you with throbbing pain at the back of it. so when her lips disappeared, her warmth, too; with a pulsing head, you opened your eyes.</em></p>
