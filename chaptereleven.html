    <h1>Chapter Eleven </h1>
    <p>you soon found out that you, in fact, do get seasick. and despite being on sea for a few days already, it only seems to be getting worse by the hour.</p>
    <p>the crew is nice. against all expectations, the sailors have been awfully nice and kind to you; nothing like the grim atmosphere they usually displayed in the bar. it was a refreshing change, one that comforted you, too. and knowing this entire trip you would receive daily visits from arlecchino herself, only made it much better.</p>
    <p>she knew you had gotten worse by the day. every single time she visited, your head was buried even deeper in your pillow; the boxes of medicine on your bedside table have been emptied long ago. it was tough, for sure. waking up, getting breakfast while trying to not succumb to the unsteady movement of the boat. every day you went outside, hoping to feel better, but each day another fatuus noticed your pale face.</p>
    <p>you didn&rsquo;t care much, fortunately. so, you simply returned to your chambers, trying to continue working on your files. and after a few hours, you put them away and tried to relax, maybe took one or two painkillers, and rested for as long as you could. the days were short, the nights were long, and this voyage was already getting on your nerves slightly. and yet, you didn&rsquo;t regret a thing.</p>
    <p>especially after hearing the soft knock on your door.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;come in&rdquo; you said, your voice muffled by the pillow. the door opened, and she stepped inside, closing it softly in her wake.</p>
    <p>you took a peak. it was warm in your room, which made you feel all the more comfortable when the sickness got too much. a cozy cave of comfort for you during those horrendous times.</p>
    <p>and it also proved to be beneficial as you saw her undressing her jacket slowly, carefully draping it over the chair she decided to sit on.</p>
    <p>you studied the fade of her arm; how high up it got, and wondered just how exactly it got to that point. what caused her curse to flare up? has it always been like this, and more importantly, is it still ongoing?</p>
    <p>&ldquo;how do you feel?&rdquo; she whispered, leaning back in her chair. she crossed her legs, and looked down on you.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;not good.&rdquo; you said plainly. your stomach was killing you, so was the rest of your body. you had been dizzy for days.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;any regrets just yet? or can i presume that you will return to your work as soon as you have recovered?&rdquo; she asked, and despite her rather distant demeanour, you could sense the small hint of cordial worry she expressed.</p>
    <p>part of you felt good, almost honored that someone like her would worry about you. and in the end, she had always been kind to you.</p>
    <p>on the other hand, you doubt she would treat anyone differently. perhaps people who do ill; you had only heard how she treats those - and yet, there was always a small spark of hope that the warmth she radiated was genuine.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay. once we&rsquo;re there, i&rsquo;ll be better again.&rdquo; you said, turning your head to give her a small smile.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you do not seem well. is there anything you need? more medication, perhaps? i could order one of my children to provide you with some.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;your children are the operatives, right? what about the other sailors? all this time and i barely understand the house of the hearth.&rdquo; you said, your head spinning as you let it fall into the pillow again.</p>
    <p>you&rsquo;re met with a dim smile. &ldquo;want me to tell you a story?&rdquo; she asked. you nodded, turning onto the side and looking at her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;well, if you oh so desire, i shall tend to an ill persons wishes.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>and while she explains to you the dynamics and rules of the house of the hearth, you find yourself staring at her, your ability to properly listen to her fading here and there. you either get lost in her eyes, or her chains on her waist; her blackened arms and the swell of her breasts were also regular objectives of your admiring gaze.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>of course, being you, you still heard everything she said.</p>
    <p>about how she became father after she assassinated her predecessor, her own &lsquo;mother&rsquo;; how she reformed the entire structure of the house from the ground up, and how her children operate. three names, two of which you had read about during your research, were engraved in your mind: lyney, lynette and freminet. two famous magicians and a rather reserved diver. they sounded like lovely people, although it still seemed funny to you how people of your age are considered children by her.</p>
    <p>let&rsquo;s hope she will never see you as one. after all, the chances of you joining the house like that were basically zero, theoretically however, they were not. you have come to a point in which getting closer to her was all you wanted, no matter how. leaving your old life behind permanently didn&rsquo;t sound like that much of a deal anymore, so you would be more than willing to start over for and with her.</p>
    <p>although you wouldn&rsquo;t want to be her child. at least not like that.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i still can&rsquo;t believe i have number four of the fatui harbingers personally watching over me.&rdquo; you said and sat up again, supporting your unstable body with your elbows. &ldquo;what an honor that is.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>she smirked in return, a flicker of red met your face as she shifted in her seat, her gaze on you hardening just slightly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i can&rsquo;t say i bestow every person i meet with this kind of hospitality, but ultimately, you have been a great help in our investigations so far, vanessa. and i appreciate your efforts.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>your heart felt warmer at that, and the smile on your face as an inevitable action.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m glad i could be so beneficial for your cause.&rdquo; you said, an edge of smugness behind it. &ldquo;but i do wonder what awaits me in the nation of justice. would you enlighten me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you will continue your doings as you like. our meetings will continue, and i will personally ensure your safety.&rdquo; she spoke in a calm, almost diplomatical manner. as if you were some high running political figure, about to be escorted.</p>
    <p>you nod. &ldquo;i heard the crime rates in fontaine were exceptionally high. much so the cases involving women. and i just happen to present myself as one.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;which is why i, as well as the house of the hearth, will grant you protection. and perhaps you would like to give some combat lessons a thought, or two?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you groaned and this woman had the audacity to chuckle.</p>
    <p>somehow, talking to her today seemed lighter. casual, almost, but all the more pleasant the further the conversation treaded.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;maybe.&rdquo; you said into the pillow.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i didn&rsquo;t understand you. could you perhaps repeat yourself?&rdquo; she asked, and you knew she was taking delight in this. you groaned again, but laughed regardless.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;maybe i&rsquo;ll give your offer a thought. or two.&rdquo; you said and looked at her. she looked stunning, even slightly blurred. those meds and the sea truly got to you; your body feeling like it was falling apart slowly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re considering my offer.&rdquo; she said calmly. &ldquo;and i promise you that you shall only undergo the best of training. i will organize everything according to your wishes and preferences.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no one watches us. me.&rdquo; you quickly correct yourself. despite your growing ambitions of getting closer to her, and your ego that she would be good with you by her side; you were still your own individual. and you don&rsquo;t like people noticing, or watching you. in fact, even with her by your side you would dread even the most innocent of children's eyes watching you trying to hold a sword for the first time.</p>
    <p>well, especially with her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;that shall be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>her tone grew softer by the minute, yet you learned that this is just how she is. once you dive into a topic with her, she grows passionate, she listens and grows impossibly compassionate, depending on what you talk about. it&rsquo;s a delight to have her around. and that makes you fall even harder for her; and you are already doing so at a pace you have never seen on you before.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;thank you&rdquo; you said quietly, but you know she understood you. she always did, in such moments.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;would you like some more rest? i can, of course, always leave you to it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you nod, bury your face in your pillow as it burns red. you wanted to say it, and you knew she waited patiently for you to potentially add something to your statement.</p>
    <p>and yet, nothing left your mouth. and you expected her to leave, to take her jacket and open the door after putting the chair back to where it was, but she didn&rsquo;t. she waited.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and for once in your life, you felt wholeheartedly understood. not the usual pressure of wanting a response, wanting closure or something like that. maybe she had places to be, maybe not, but most people who had dealt with this version of you - the one with even less energy than usually - they always walked away.</p>
    <p>arlecchino didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t leave yet.&rdquo; you said, the &lsquo;yet&rsquo; a painful add-on. but her staying longer was more calming than her leaving at all.</p>
    <p>it was silent for a few moments and you could almost hear her contemplating whether or not this was a good idea. and perhaps you already mentally prepared for the worst, the most realistic outcome.</p>
    <p>and yet-</p>
    <p>&ldquo;if you would like that, then it shall be arranged.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you looked at her with one, squinted eye. she leaned back in her chair.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;as i said; who am i to deny an ill persons wish?&rdquo;</p>
