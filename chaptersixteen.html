    <h1>Chapter Sixteen </h1>
      <p>
        <p>as expected, you hadn&rsquo;t talked about anything after it happened. the kisses you shared that night were soft, quiet sacrileges of a shared sentiment that had been building up all those weeks and months. beautiful, really, and a love story one could easily enjoy. perhaps, it could even pass as a fairy tale - the way the wind blew through your hair, the waves seemingly growing softer, and of course, her lips against yours. it was too magical to simply put it in a tell- tale.</p>
<p>and yet, neither her nor you said anything at all.</p>
<p>that night, you went back together. she carried the blanket, her hand brushing against yours as you walked. you threw a few glances at her, seeing her smile every single time was magical, and never had it felt more rewarding to show some courage. with the memory still fresh on the lips, only rarely did you take your eyes off of her.</p>
<p>she seemed lighter, of sorts. not the juvenile relief many felt after their first kiss, but as if something entirely different has lifted off her shoulders. knowing that this was your doing, was more than just a mere win for you.</p>
<p>entering the hotel in silence was a gift. no child was up at this hour, and if they were, there was no reason for them to roam through the hallways. so, even though nothing extraordinary would happen, you were safe at least.</p>
<p>she brought you to your room, and said a quick goodbye, before walking down the corridor to retreat to her own chambers. as soon as the door closed, you leaned against it quietly. no one needed to know about the spectacle that has yet to unfold, which consisted of you throwing yourself onto the bed, giggling and kicking your feet like a schoolgirl.</p>
<p>you had just kissed number four of the fatui harbingers. someone of high authority, someone with that much power and grace;&nbsp; putty beneath your hands. the way her eyes trembled as they held your gaze will forever be ingrained in your memories; the feeling of her warm hands against hers, her slim fingers clutching yours as if you were to disappear at any moment shall be preserved until the end of time.</p>
<p>you buried your head in your pillow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you hadn&rsquo;t talked about anything, so that obviously made you wonder; would you be able to repeat what happened tonight? whenever you were alone, perhaps? for the rest of your days?</p>
<p>or was that just a one time thing - her stoic attitude too blinding, her walls too high up for you to reach, and climb, and crawl behind? you did not even want to think about that possibility. not being able to do this again sounds tedious, and undesirable. in front of the children is a matter you would understand, but when you&rsquo;re alone, that was a whole different story.</p>
<p>so, what would you be able to do now? wait for tomorrow? right, with the way your heart is still racing and the raging stomach ache, that was a horrendous idea. but going up to her room, knocking at the door and asking her what all of this meant surely was a terrible idea, too.</p>
<p>and yet, it had only been a few minutes of your ways parting, so there was no way she would be fast asleep and in bed already. if she would even sleep, that is.</p>
<p>so, ignoring the searing pain in your anxiety-infested stomach once more, you got up, didn&rsquo;t bother to put your shoes back on and carefully left your room. those next few steps felt like a lifetime; as if you walked out of one life and straight into the next. perhaps you did; perhaps this encounter would break your heart and set you all the way back to mondstadt in an instant. that was your only fear, really, and yet it was one you couldn&rsquo;t easily shake off. being rejected would not be a problem, people are people, but being rejected by her was something you wouldn&rsquo;t even wish for in your deepest and darkest nightmares.</p>
<p>and once again you asked yourself just when you fell so hard for her. and what spirit possessed you to try so hard to get her attention, the right kind, of course; the kind that makes her kiss you, and that shows her that all of this is human, indeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>a descendant of the crimson moon dynasty, a fatui harbinger, a person with so much power, strength in body and mind - it was incomprehensible to you how someone like her could potentially kiss you. but you felt empowered tonight, so you figured it was the fact that you were seemingly a nobody, that was the thrill of it all.</p>
<p>you stood in front of her door, knocking softly. nothing happened, and for a second you were scared. all kinds of possibilities went through your head at once; what if she wasn&rsquo;t here? what if she is asleep already? what if someone wakes up?</p>
<p>those fears gnawed at you slightly, and your years of masking and pushing aside, for the mere purpose of working a relatively social job, came back at once. suddenly, you felt as if you were waiting for the last guest to leave, painfully staring at the clock as they just would not finish their drink. just that this time, you weren&rsquo;t waiting for a guest, but for a person whose lips you would love to feel against yours. again. for the second - or, if we&rsquo;re being more precis, sixth - time tonight.</p>
<p>she opened the door, greeting you with a simple rather tight shirt and some pants. her eyes seemed as worn out and light as before. you didn&rsquo;t expect her to be asleep already, but were still relieved that she wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>she looked at you and stepped aside, motioning you in. closing the door behind you, she approached you as you kept your silence and didn&rsquo;t even dare to turn around.</p>
<p>suddenly, you feel dainty fingers against your own, sharp nails tracing your knuckles one by one, before ultimately coming up to stop at your wrist. she grabbed it softly, bringing your hand up to her mouth as you looked away, a deep red already washing over your entire face as she kissed your palm. she kissed you twice more; once at your wrist, again a little higher up on your forearm, making sure to help your hand down safely as she let go of you. her hand lingered near your wrist and you watched it with care, and a desire that exceeds any mortal want you had ever felt. perhaps it was the moment, perhaps it was the scenery of a woman so great, worshipping a small part of your body you usually didn&rsquo;t care much about, but under her ministrations, it made you melt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re bold.&rdquo; you said quietly. &ldquo;how come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i believe you know.&rdquo; she said, her voice matching yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do i, now?&rdquo; you asked, finally gathering the courage to look up at her. she looked at you so softly, so lovingly, you wished you could just grab her and kiss her with no worry in the world. but, despite your intimacy and the primal desires boiling deep within, she wasn&rsquo;t yours. you couldn&rsquo;t just grab her and pull her towards you; not if you didn&rsquo;t know how you would even proceed. how things are between you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i am to think that our little encounter earlier has left me with a sense of, well, boldness as you describe it. and yet, i have found myself unable to think about much more than that on our way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>that knocked the air right out of your lungs, and a smile formed on your face as you diligently quoted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m glad the feeling is mutual.&rdquo; you said, your daring eyes meeting hers once again. she caught on almost immediately, and you wondered why she was so sharp at times, and so oblivious during others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you mock me.&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t like it. that&rsquo;s my charm, remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;perhaps it is due to our insufferable nature, that i find you intriguing.&rdquo; she mumbled, her hand slowly moving upwards, caressing your forearm, your elbow, your upper arm, wandering to your shoulder and neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;and perhaps because you have wrung such reactions out of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;reactions?&rdquo; you ask her. she steps closer, invading your space, and you didn&rsquo;t mind a single bit. one of your hands wandered to her waist, resting there softly, reassuring you this was real and not like any inappropriate dreams as of late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;do i need to say it out loud?&rdquo; she asked, a hint of shyness in her firm voice. you knew it was an act. you knew she kept her walls high up even when you kissed; and oh, you made it your life&rsquo;s creed to tear those walls down and let them rot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you want to engage with me like this, you must. else, do what you want. but i can&rsquo;t promise you anything beyond the usual kindness i show you.&rdquo; you whispered.</p>
<p>while setting boundaries was rather difficult for you, this one fact was easy to roll off your tongue. if there is anything you despise in this world, it was dishonesty. and she seemed to have understood it, giving by her dramatically deep breath and the way she removed herself entirely from you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what if i cannot promise you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;then i will leave and pretend this never happened. and i will leave after finishing the research for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>she gasped, her eyes widening. &ldquo;would this situation still occur if we hadn&rsquo;t kissed?&rdquo; she said, speaking what happened aloud for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;perhaps not. those are the consequences for giving in to such indulgence.&rdquo; you said firmly. against all odds, against everything you have known, there was no tension in the air. just a quiet acceptance and contemplation, and you had every intention to stay for as long as she needed. besides, leaving without a response would only postpone the inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;i have never kissed anyone before. nor have i ever found myself blushing to this extent, and my heart hasn&rsquo;t beaten as fast in a long time, too. is that to your satisfaction?&rdquo; she asked you, the words leaving her flawlessly, as if she had them prepared for a long time. and unlike all those other times, there was no sarcastic remark whatsoever. you nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;indeed so. but i cannot help but wonder, what was all that touching about earlier? kissing my fingers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s not like you didn&rsquo;t know, but you wanted to see if she knows. which she does, you&rsquo;re sure of it, but you still wanted confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i merely tried to show my appreciation, nothing more. perhaps even indulge in a feeling that would certainly endanger our professional relationship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>you rolled your eyes<em>. to hell with that.</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;yet i quickly realized that this exceeds the bonds of such a relationship. and so, i want to thank you for coming here again. i wanted to talk to you about this situation we find ourselves in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so all of this is a situation?&rdquo; you chuckled, but stayed serious nonetheless. despite it all, she seemed rather clueless. when was the last time she had talked to someone about such intimate matters, you wondered; if she even did that at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;not a situation, but rather an encounter i wasn&rsquo;t able to shake off. perhaps you would like to share more about it, but personally, i would-&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;i would like this to happen again.&rdquo; she stayed firm in her tone and you couldn&rsquo;t help but laugh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;did you just formally ask me if we could be exclusive?&rdquo; you asked her, biting your lip to not break down further. she didn&rsquo;t all too amused at your reaction, but then again - when did she?</p>
<p>&ldquo;i merely asked you for another kiss.&rdquo; she said almost innocently, and what you found in her eyes was once again this little, small broken thing that craved normalcy, however advanced and romantic it may be. it broke your heart to some extent, but it also gave you a strange sense of excitement. seeing this woman unravel for the first time, letting herself feel something; it was exciting, of sorts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if i give you one, will you grant me a question?&rdquo; you asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i admire your greed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you need the kiss, i need the answer to my question.&rdquo; you said with a snarky undertone. you enjoyed your banter like this, your own unique way of flirting, and for once you knew that she was aware just of what you did right now.</p>
<p>she smiled at you and took your hand again, playing with your fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i agree to those terms.&rdquo; she said and leaned in painfully slow. you sighed in&nbsp; annoyance, cupped her cheek, and pulled her closer, crashing your lips against hers.</p>
<p>the kiss was soft, tentative, and filled with all the unspoken things from last night. soon enough, she stepped into your space again, her hands wandering, one settling on your hip, the other one wrapping around your torso, holding you close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>you felt her chest against yours and it made your head spin, a soft moan escaping your lips as your lips moved against hers, trying to deepen the kiss a little but ultimately failing due to a certain someone not adapting properly. however, this is still new to her, so she will get a pass, for now.</p>
<p>your own hands pulled her closer; one against her cheek, feeling the warmth, the other at her neck, your nails softly scratching it, making her sigh into the kiss. you figured she might like it, for no particular reason. it just made sense that someone as starved as hers would give into such trivial physical contact. and you were anything but complaining.</p>
<p>your little visit in her room lasted for another hour. most of it was spent kissing, or talking about rather superficial matters. you listened, carefully so, and gained more insight into this wounded little soul that was &lsquo;perrie&rsquo;. you enjoyed it, more than anything, actually.</p>
<p>after everything that happened tonight, you were happy. feeling her arms around you like this, feeling her warmth and indulging in her words did all it could to soothe your soul and prepare you for a new day.</p>
<p>and when that day arrived, you woke up with a smile on your face, motivated and refreshed despite your relative lack of sleep and proper rest. you were relieved to see her door still closed. perhaps she has taken your suggestion into accord after all.</p>
<p>you headed down the corridor and met some of the children, happily eating breakfast together. you smiled at them, they smiled back; a pleasant encounter, no matter how many times it happened.</p>
<p>you casually get yourself a bowl and some cereal, pouring fresh milk over it, while ignoring your intolerance to it once again; you always did, after all, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter much anyway. and just as you led the fourth spoon of your breakfast towards your mouth, a realization crept upon you, making you almost drop your spoon if it wasn&rsquo;t for all those young souls around you, and a small shiver running down your spine.</p>
<p>last night, you took her first kiss, which was already rather unusual at her age. and that brings you to something bigger, something that might change the dynamic between you just a little more. and perhaps this was a rather wild train of thought, but all the more reasonable given the circumstances; but who had sex without even having their first kiss?</p>
