    <h1>Chapter Eight</h1>
      <p>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&rsquo;s been weeks since you came to an agreement; weeks since you made a seemingly small little pact with the highest ranking fatua you have ever met. and surprisingly, it still did not frighten you, nor did it unsettle or scare you. it became part of your daily routine - investigating and searching, before and after work, as well as on your days off. sometimes, during less confidential stuff, you would even read out in the sun, yet oftentimes one could find you, seemingly locked away, in your room at your grandmother&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">despite that, however, you and her had a strict agreement on meeting up at the bar to discuss trivial matters. it was safer, and certainly would save your grandmother a heart attack, and your family some gossip.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">the distance was pleasant, but did little to soothe the slow burning flame within your body; the one that was slowly ignited by none other than arlecchino. with practised ease, however, you were able to suppress such small emotions. but did you really want to?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">to say this liking you took on her was new, was an understatement. why else would you have cried so intensely as you did upon hearing a mere rumor; the thought of her not being here was simply too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you wanted to know everything about her; from how she prefers her tea in the morning, to which colors she likes, what her shoe size was and how her skin felt underneath your finger tips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">an absurd spectrum of wants and desires, and yet, you found yourself curious about such things the entire time. you would never assume anything, of course, you weren&rsquo;t the type to do so. thought of it as disrespectful, perhaps even invading, especially if it was someone like her - a strong, usually intimidating force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, under the soft light of the bar, she seemed like nothing but and exhausted little being sometimes, although she would never say, nor express it differently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;say, why do you want to know all this?&rdquo; you asked her quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">there were heaps of paper between you, all kinds of files and records of the cities you were born and raised in, as well as those of your parents, and those of your grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for every other person, this would feel like an invasion of privacy. too much information, especially giving your entire origin to a fatui harbinger. and yet, you didn&rsquo;t mind. you always tried to be open about your life - at least as open as one can be. you laughed with the guests, and whenever someone shared something you could somewhat relate to, you were among the first to respond. during drinking games, too; and during fleeting, deep conversations with strangers you would never see again, it was just about the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you were an open book. and many people called you out on it, warned you about what that could mean; which is precisely why the only person who knows about your deal with the knave is none other than diona herself. if the letter already arrived, of course.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it took you long enough for this question, don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo; she asked, a slight smile on her lips. she was sipping on a glass of lemonade; yes, you were just as surprised when she ordered some. apparently she wanted to test it and see if it suits the taste of her children.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a matter most curious to you, too. after all; how come such a graceful and young-looking woman was the leader of an orphanage? and why did some of her underlings, or operatives, call her &lsquo;father&rsquo;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;at some point i got curious.&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s none of my business after all. though, weeks of going through records and you joining me at some point made it appear as if asking wouldn&rsquo;t hurt.&rdquo; you explain, putting another file to the side. it was much too old; at least for your family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">your family has always lived an ordinary life. and that, of course, could not compete with the rich history of clans and political figures in mondstadt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;allow me to reward your curiosity, then.&rdquo; she said and stood up from her stool. you were sitting at the bar, at four in the morning. the best time for seemingly shady cooperation, and you knew that if your boss found out, you would certainly be in trouble. and yet, watching this absolute sight of a woman, powerful in her wake, walking behind the bar to pour herself some lemonade, adorning it with a perfect slice of fresh lemon, makes it all worth it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">instead of sitting down again, she turns around, facing you from behind the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;flames course through my body like blood,&rdquo; she states and looks at you, her eyes soft on yours. &ldquo;i think that is enough of a reason as to why i am investigating this matter.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;and what part do i play in this?&rdquo; you asked, carefully this time. knowing this is a rather personal matter for her certainly made it easy for you to offend her, and you would give it your all to avoid just that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you hail from khaenri'ah. even if you were not born there, your parents were, and that sheer fact about your heritage is important for my investigation.&rdquo; she speaks sharply, with an edge you hadn&rsquo;t heard before. however, it failed to do anything to you. so, you just tilted your head, listening diligently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">her smile faltered and she leaned back, trying to seem unfazed about your calm. and that, in return, let a satisfying warmth coil deep in your stomach.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it is rare to encounter those who hail from khaenri&rsquo;ah nowadays. or at least those who are willing to speak, willing to look into their past instead of pushing it away.&rdquo; she says, walking around the counter and taking a seat next to you. her legs cross once again; she always does that. and it keeps on intriguing you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and maybe it interests you in a different manner, as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;why would people push their own heritage away?&rdquo; you asked quietly, looking into her eyes and staying there for as best as you could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you had been content with yourself for as long as you could remember. bold and brutal honesty, acceptance towards even the harshest of truths. it was something not everyone could deal with. something some people treasure about you regardless; an appreciation for old arts, at least that&rsquo;s what it felt like.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so why would anyone not be honest to themselves at least? you will never fully understand it, but it&rsquo;s not your place to be in either. not your place to judge, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;khaenri'ahns are said to be different, to be cursed. i don&rsquo;t know how much truth there is behind this, except for my own situation, of course, which makes me question any possible heritage of mine.&rdquo; she explains and you listen. despite her best efforts to remain nonchalant, you could see there was some kind of pain lingering in her gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;so i&rsquo;m helping you with finding that out?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;because i&rsquo;m the only khaenri'ahn who is normal about it all?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;indeed&rdquo; she says with a nod and sips from her lemonade again. you watch her as she closes her eyes and leaves the drink in her mouth for a second longer than any other normal human would. you found it enticing, but quickly averted your gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you smiled to yourself quietly, not letting it show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">because white everyone else saw this dangerous diplomat, when she was with you like this, she was just a woman. a woman with some secrets up her sleeve, still, but each interaction made you trust her more and more. perhaps it was still foolish, but your gut feeling never betrayed you so far, so you doubt it would when it came to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;now, let us continue for tonight. or, would you rather we end our little chit-chat session?&rdquo; she said, not looking at you, but the documents in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;continue&rdquo; you respond plainly. &ldquo;for just a little longer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you took another file, opened it. and yet, you couldn&rsquo;t concentrate. her breathing was basically enough to undo you, and yet, you found it interesting nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you thought about her, her arms, her eyes. maybe even her hair. whatever it was, you will find out about it. you will find clues and help her understand herself; give it your all. for both, the slight desire to help lost people finding at least a bit of themselves again, and because she seemed like she needed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">though it still surprised you a little that she really cares so much, she would entrust those things to a stranger. it made her cute, of sorts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps not knowing where one is from does leave a bitter taste, even in the most delectable of mouths.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">wait, what?</span></em></p>
