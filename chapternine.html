    <h1>Chapter Nine</h1>
      <p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">when she came in that next day, something about her demeanor changed the second she laid eyes upon your midriff. not that she was staring at it like all those drunkards did, far from it, but the sheer look in her eyes made the bottom of your stomach coil tight with a soothing sensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps you took a liking in her. who knows, at the end of the day. although your body slowly but steadily adapted to the newfound emotions within, your head still struggled with processing it all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">it&rsquo;s been a while since you last felt that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">so, naturally, now that you did, you had to overindulge in it with everything you had. spending so much time with her equipped you with a fair share of confidence; one that could not easily be messed with. and it only grew with each passing day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;something caught your eye?&rdquo; you asked with a slight smile. you linked your hands behind your back, tilted your head, hoping this rather sarcastic obliviousness would reach her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">over the past weeks you noticed she had trouble catching up on certain social interactions - be it sayings or gestures. not that you were any different, of course, but noticing that in a person of this position was satisfyingly odd regardless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m merely adoring this little vision of yours. if i&rsquo;m not mistaken, it hasn&rsquo;t been there last time we saw each other, yes?&rdquo; she said and sat down in front of you, the counter providing enough of a comfortable distance, as per usual. and slowly, painfully slowly, you began to dread it just a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;it appears as if some wonders happen overnight&rdquo; you said. &ldquo;and funnily enough, i was drinking your lemonade as i received it. in fact, it appeared in a glass. almost broke it while trying to get it out, and honestly, i&rsquo;m not so sure what to do with it now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she raised a brow, folding her hands neatly in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i suppose your experience with combat has been close to zero, so far?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you nod, no embarrassment in sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you once encountered a young sailor, sword by his hip, yet he never used it up until that point. he was met with laughter, his comrades ridiculing him; mostly in a joking manner, but he still appeared hurt by their words. the hydro vision on his back made him a target of even more shenanigans.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">next time the crew came into the bar, about two months later, the young gentleman wasn&rsquo;t with them anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you can only assume what happened; after all, there were countless possibilities. but based on the silence of each and every single one of them, you could tell that he must have lost his life somewhere among the waves and sea beasts, the robberies and fights. especially when sailing close to the shore, which is precisely what they did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t have a proper reason to indulge in self-defense lessons so far&rdquo; and also, no social battery whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;of course that is entirely your business alone, but you do realize that such training might be rather beneficial, especially now that the gods bestowed you with their favor?&rdquo; she asks. you shrug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">of course, it was in the back of your head countless of times over the past few years. travelling to dornman port, to mondstadt, to wherever, seemed impossible without suitable combat skills. yet, while you preferred to keep to yourself during those trips, you never traveled alone. eula was always there to protect you and your troupe on your way between the port and the city, and every other longer journey would be done in a greater group, too. there was not a single doubt you had in one of the knights of favonius, despite your slight dislike towards them never fading entirely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i&rsquo;m fine&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t think i need that. also i don&rsquo;t think i would be that good at it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;that usually never held anyone back from anything, don&rsquo;t you think? at least in all those colorful tales the younger children prefer to read. well, there is one of them who enjoys doing so even at a slightly older age, and that doesn&rsquo;t keep him from at least trying things that somehow fit into his expertise.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you raise a brow at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;too bad this is not about children&rsquo;s books. i would prefer to stay realistic.&rdquo; you said, turning around to pull out a carafe of freshly made lemonade; squeezed, brewed and set aside just this evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and secretly, you made this just for her. barely anyone orders homemade beverages anyway; most customers are too caught up with booze, water and the occasional fonta or mocktail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, she loved that stuff. for whatever reason - that one glass yesternight was enough for the entire week in your eyes. but you would never leave any of your guests unsatiated; especially not her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;thank you&rdquo; she said and you poured her some into a fresh glass. putting a lemon on top, as well as a small umbrella you had laying around. it was silly, yet the smile she gave you was the closest to a genuine smile you had gotten from her so far. and you appreciated it nonetheless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you&rsquo;re welcome&rdquo; you said and put the carafe back into the fridge underneath the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;i still think of it as rather reckless to be in possession of a vision and not use it. there are many who would like to abuse this power, and yet here you are, not bothering about such trivial things. i once had one of my children ask me if i could equip them with utilities similar to a vision, just because his sister met the favor of the seven before he did. do you understand, how treasurable such a blessing can be?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you nodded, not paying her little yapfest much mind. you wouldn&rsquo;t easily be swayed by that, despite her words making an awful lot of sense in your ears. more than you would like to admit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">although you, of course, appreciated that she once again shared something about her alleged &lsquo;children&rsquo;, a matter most curious to you still, and something she rarely talked about unfortunately.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you suspected that a lot of them might be younger than you, but just like the kid she just described; they couldn&rsquo;t be merely, say, eight years old. and you know firsthand that some of those children are way older than you, yet respected her nonetheless. it was still a mystery to you, and yet, you knew this was something that would resolve over time. you were looking forward to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;the knights of favonius take great care of mondstadt and beyond. and i doubt i would ever travel much further than liyue, maybe even inazuma. and even then, i wouldn&rsquo;t be alone. so-&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;what would you say about paying the nation of justice a little visit?&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">for the first time in all those weeks, she interrupted you. and it didn&rsquo;t bother you in the slightest, and it didn&rsquo;t appear as disrespectful to you, nothing of that sort. it was charming, of sorts, but only on her for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;you suggest i travel to fontaine?&rdquo; you said, a small smile hidden behind the disbelief. &ldquo;and why would i do that?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">she smiled and lowered her gaze, closing her eyes even as she took a sip from her lemonade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;to keep on assisting me in my research. duty calls, and yet i find our work together most intriguing. so naturally, it would be a shame to miss out on it. so, if you would like to accompany me to fontaine to continue our work there, i would most welcome your sentiment. of course, you could stay with the house of the hearth, and any other expenses shall be covered as well.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and that left you speechless. you looked at her, your eyes just a little bit bigger than usual, but it betrayed the surprise in them all the more. she could see right through you, so she smiled, knowing that she had caught you off-guard once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;take your time, there is no immediate rush in decisions. but, since i would have to leave in due time, please tell me your thoughts at the end of the week. no matter what you decide on, please take your time with the research. there is no pressure in those matters, after all.&rdquo; she said, finishing her lemonade. she was unbelievably fast today, as if she never planned on staying long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">which would be weird, considering there was still a lot to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;if it&rsquo;s not inconvenient for you, i&rsquo;ll take my leave&rdquo; she said and stood up from her seat; you still stare at her, still in disbelief over what she offered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">what exactly she said as she left the bar is unclear to you. your mind kept on drifting to the possibility of travelling to fontaine with a fatui harbinger. with a dangerous, ruthless person, who just so happens to enjoy lemonade, and long talks at night. who doesn&rsquo;t seem to be fazed at just about anything, but expresses just the right amount of care when necessary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">this stunning woman, who just so entered your life at a peaceful period of your life, one that would be considered the &lsquo;prime&rsquo; by most people, yet for you it was a time like any other.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">while other people travelled through teyvat, fought heroic battles, wrote their own stories in their unique little books of life, you stood behind the counter of a bar that already stood there when you were a child, walking through the streets while holding your grandmother&rsquo;s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">you never saw the appeal in this overly adventurous life all those other people had. never saw the appeal in participating in so much trouble, such loud situations. you loved your peace, and wouldn&rsquo;t change it for anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">and yet, perhaps her offering you a chance to actually go somewhere, could be an interesting experience, too. not like all those other people had; a turbulent storm of a life before settling down in a few years, no.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">perhaps arlecchino the knave was the beginning of a whole new chapter in your book, and for once in your life, you welcomed this change.</span></p>
