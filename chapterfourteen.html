    <h1>Chapter Fourteen </h1>
    <p>the walk back was long, uneventful, even. and you seemingly followed her like a lost little child chasing after their parents.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>after you began talking, it didn&rsquo;t take long for her to get into deeper matters. as you stood there, facing her, she began to talk, her eyes looking anywhere but at you.</p>
    <p>apparently she was once an orphan of the house of the hearth. the former knave, her so-called &lsquo;mother&rsquo; was the exact opposite from what one could call a good parent, the complete opposite of the &lsquo;father&rsquo; the children know today.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>she had a friend back then, but from what you could understand, this was a bond far deeper than sheer friendship. her name was clervie, and she was the biological daughter of crucabena.</p>
    <p>to hear what happened afterwards - arlecchino killing her own mother, thinking it was her fault that clervie died, and how she became harbinger and took over the house of the hearth, rebuilding it from the very ground.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>the stories about their deaths - clervie, lilly, countless other innocent children, who had only ever wanted to live a normal life - it sickened you. and even worse, seeing the remorse and pain in her gaze that she desperately tried to hide, maybe even thought was successful, hurt so much more. one person alone does not deserve to carry such burdens, and while you don&rsquo;t understand why she told you this much after weeks of beating around the bush, you knew you had to do at least something to support her, to take the burden off her shoulders and make her relax a little. although this might prove a hard task, given the only indicator on how she could possibly feel was the quiet staggered breath she let out when she talked about clervie.</p>
    <p>you looked at her as you walked, took in her form as you like to do. she didn&rsquo;t seem out of breath like you were; after all, despite the heavy topics you talked about, you still trained a little. explaining the basics of swords and polearms quickly turned into her realizing that you had no interest in such things. and so, she concluded, manipulating dendro with your bare mind would suffice.</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;i have a feeling this might be the most suitable for you, anyway.&rdquo; </em>she even said, and honestly? you one hundred percent agree.</p>
    <p>shortly after, she taught you how to dodge - a skill you were awfully good at, blaming it onto your years in school, when everyone tried to throw balls at you in all types of games, and you always got away from them successfully.</p>
    <p>even she herself was impressed, and yet, the few motions she shot into your direction weren&rsquo;t enough. before you knew it, she elegantly lunged at you, making you fall onto the ground, yet did not even let that happen. she caught you as you fell, immediately so, and all you saw as you opened your eyes that had previously closed to prepare for the worst, were two red crosses narrowing slightly. the warm feeling of her hand on your back was gone all too soon, as she helped you back to your feet.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll practice that tomorrow, if you would like to continue.&rdquo; she said with a slight smile, and for the first time, you couldn&rsquo;t enjoy it, so you simply just nodded. knowing this was part of her facade, this is how she presented herself to not let the bleeding little child within come through, straight up hurt.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;sure.&rdquo; you said and reciprocated her smile. &ldquo;i&rsquo;d like that.&rdquo;</em></p>
    <p><em>&ldquo;oh? does that mean i made you comfortable enough to actually pursue self-defense?&rdquo; she chuckled as she took off her jacket, shook it out and let it hang loosely over her forearm.&nbsp;</em></p>
    <p><em>you stared. shamelessly, at the soft curve of her shoulder, her tattoos, the fade of the burns she had to endure.</em></p>
    <p>because on top of everything, her bloodline also connected her to the so-called &lsquo;crimson moon&rsquo;, and a curse was placed atop her. whenever she feels strongly, her arms burn down.</p>
    <p>and yet, despite its tragedy, you couldn&rsquo;t help but admire her body in its whole. she was mesmerizing, and despite her abilities, so incredibly soft. which is exactly why you needed her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i managed to make you comfortable enough to open up, so i would like to thank you this time.&rdquo; you replied, raising a brow and trying your hardest to seem nonchalant. luckily, it seemed to work, heavy emphasis on the &lsquo;seemed&rsquo;.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you made me comfortable, indeed. although what i told you was merely a fraction of my life, so far. perhaps i might tell you some more stories, if time permits it.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>intrigued, you smiled brightly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;oh?&rdquo; you asked, taking a few steps into her direction. &ldquo;so, tell me all the childrens gossip! did they paint your face while you were asleep once? oh, or did anyone insult one of your colleagues? not that i would take them as such, but every herd has their black sheep, right?&rdquo; you chuckled, and she looked at you with an amused expression.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you can have a wild imagination if you want, i think that to be a good quality.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;really? then, would it also be a bit too imaginary of me to assume that, despite your young fatherhood, you still had a love interest during that time?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you were met with silence. her putting her jacket on without a word, before ultimately taking a deep breath.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;i wouldn&rsquo;t know why that would be of interest to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;curiosity, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; you lied, one of the times in your life. &ldquo;just saying, i could tell you a fair share about my past experiences, too. or are they of little interest to you?&rdquo; you smiled at her and she began to walk past you, slowly starting to make her way back to the court of fontaine.</p>
    <p>she stayed silent at that for a long time, and you&rsquo;re sure she wasn&rsquo;t prepared for such a scene. she knew you were confident and rather straightforward, but you slowly but steadily had enough. you felt yourself wanting her a little more every single day, so you decided to be no fool and ultimately try it. nothing could go wrong, after all; if you were to be rejected, worst case is that she&rsquo;d send you back to mondstadt, and that honestly wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>although something within you told you this wouldn&rsquo;t just be a simple heartbreak. you ignored that for now.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i find myself quite curious, indeed. and yet, i do not see in what way such stories would benefit our cause.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>she didn&rsquo;t look at you once, didn&rsquo;t even turn around. and that&rsquo;s how you knew you hit a spot. which one exactly stayed unknown, however.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;to make it short, however, i have experienced some things in that regard. all of those experiences were quite pleasant, and made me no stranger to intimacy of any kind. is that satisfying enough for you?&rdquo; she responded, and a part of you melted at her admission.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;more than that, yes.&rdquo; you said softly and just looked at her. something in the way she walked had changed, as if she was driven by a tension previously unknown to you. whatever it was, it made your stomach tighten. something about this wasn&rsquo;t entirely right, but perhaps that&rsquo;s for you to find out soon enough.</p>
    <p>as soon as you returned, you immediately got to your room and changed. your clothes were stained at some parts, and you felt rather gross over all. and yet, there was no time to properly shower; the dinner would take place in less than thirty minutes, so at least freshening up a little was on the table.</p>
    <p>washing your face and fixing your hair, you thought about what happened today, about all the intimate details of the encounter. about her childhood, the injustice she seemingly bestowed upon herself; and yet, she does all of this for dozens of souls who were just as lost as her own. perhaps all those children are being sent to dangerous missions, yes, but they are first and foremost kids without a home, who most likely hadn&rsquo;t even had proper food in weeks upon their admission to the house. but she takes them in, and nurses them into wonderful people.</p>
    <p>your heart skipped a beat at that realization. as you leaned back, stretching your neck a little, you took a deep breath. no one would believe this, absolutely no one, that a harbinger does so many good deeds. no one needed to, anyway, since you don&rsquo;t talk about your time here with anyone. well, except for diona.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>and that girl will have a blast once you tell her about the recent events.</p>
    <p>it doesn&rsquo;t take long for a child, foltz, to knock at your door, saying he came to fetch you. as you walk down the corridor, you could feel something radiating off of him; perhaps it was caution, or curiosity? but he kept walking in front of you, at a very normal pace, although his head was slightly tilted the entire time, focusing all his attention on you.</p>
    <p>as you arrived at the dining hall, the tables were already lavishly decked. dozens of plates, loads of food; even more so next to the big grill near the huge windows. back home, people did not grill inside, but you suppose it couldn&rsquo;t be helped in the middle of a technological nation such as fontaine. you already had to walk so far for some training, surely no one wanted to go the extra mile and do that again for dinner.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;here we are! enjoy your food later!&rdquo; foltz said as he turned towards you, linking his hands behind his back. just like a young little gentleman. you smiled at him, thanked him, and felt a warmth in your stomach. this feels just like diona, but even closer, although you cannot put a finger on it.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;vanessa.&rdquo; a deep, silken voice spoke to you from behind. you turned around immediately, anticipation already tingling at your fingertips.</p>
    <p>you looked into her eyes. she seemed calmer again, perhaps she used this short break to compose herself too, although you didn&rsquo;t even know where she went after you arrived at the house. but no matter what; she looked young in this light, softer than you had ever seen her. and something about her radiated a strange warmth.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;arlecchino.&rdquo; you responded with a smile. &ldquo;this venue is lovely, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i do hope it accommodates to your needs. shall you want something in particular, do not hesitate to tell me.&rdquo; she said with a cordial tone, the one she usually keeps up around her children, you observed. you nodded and she left you again.</p>
    <p>the evening was beautiful, and you have never enjoyed childrens laughter more than tonight. after announcing the beginning of the dinner, the smallest children already queued up in front of the grill, waiting for chapleau to serve them sausages, steaks, and all kinds of skewers and vegetables. after an hour or so, lyney took over the grill. after came many more children whose names you haven&rsquo;t hear much, so they didn&rsquo;t stick - but all of them must have been around your age.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>whenever you wanted to get up and get in line yourself, someone was always there to fetch your plate and get some meat on there themselves. it was adorable, having this small army of children ready to fight for who gets your plate and fills it up. to entertain them further, you asked for one piece at a time and always asked for the smallest one, so everyone could get their turn. one girl, whose name you remember, always came back for another round, too. heloir. while the others left at some point, she came back&nbsp; every single time, trying to fetch you food. in the end, you sent her away to eat something herself.</p>
    <p>all the while, you had a slight feeling to being watched. from afar. perhaps by the head of the house, sipping on a glass of wine as she witnessed the display in front of her with great joy.</p>
    <p>your eyes met briefly a few times, and each time, your heart fluttered.</p>
    <p>despite everything, you have never known greater hospitality.</p>
    <p>soon, the party came to an end. she fetched you and reassured you the dishes will be taken care of. seeing lyney and lynette retreating quite early was a relief; they had done enough.</p>
    <p>arlecchino took you with her as you took a small walk outside; coming to a stop atop the hotel bouffes d&rsquo;ete, in front of the hotel debord, where you found yourself leaning against the railing, watching over fontaine while the stars shone down on you.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;the court of fontaine is a wicked place. it&rsquo;s better to be careful and not get lost among the waves that surge through it.&rdquo;&nbsp; she said, looking at the skyline in front of her. the soft lights, countless of houses and the quiet streets of such a flourishing nation - it was beautiful, and far more pompous than mondstadt or dornman port could ever be.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>yet, you only looked at her.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re doing so much for a nation that is not your home, for children you call your own. i wasn&rsquo;t here when it happened, but i read plenty. i admire you.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;oh? so that journalist did include some information about me? what a pity, the legal process will be ugly.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you chuckled.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no, nothing about you, don&rsquo;t worry. but reading so much about all kinds of people and knowing someone as capable as you was involved did make me think that you had your hands in all of that, too. especially after reading a special column about lyney, lynette and freminet.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>now it was her turn to smile.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i see. i&rsquo;m very glad she kept me hidden in the dark, and i appreciate your sentiment, as well as your praise for the matter. but i must agree tho whatever column you might have read; that little team of three did all they could. they, among some other capable people, were the true backbone of saving this nation from the impending doom. i merely had a tea party or two with the right people and, well, even resorted to physical matters once.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you let go of the railing and turned towards her. &ldquo;physical matters?&rdquo; you asked, but still met her with an open mind. surely a fatui harbinger must resort to potential violence at least once in their career, and while you can&rsquo;t properly see it for her, she is still a dutiful person who does whatever has to be done.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;to be entirely honest, i have tried to take the hydro archons gnosis away from her. back when it was still believed that furina was the hydro archon, i surprised her at night. at a bench near the blacksmith nonetheless.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>you smiled, picturing it in front of your inner eye. and yet, her bland admission to where this situation took place, gave you just the blueprint.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;so, somewhere over there?&rdquo; you asked, pointing towards the book stand you still wanted to visit.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>of course, you knew very well where the blacksmith was. at the other end of fontaine, near the palais mermonia. you&rsquo;ve been there, briefly, and yet playing dumb like this delights your very core.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;no, not quite.&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;towards this building, the palais mermonia.&rdquo; she sounded young now, unbothered and innocent - as if all of this truly was her home and nothing more. your heart clenched for a second.</p>
    <p>she points at the iudexes&rsquo; office and you nod, following her motion, but still missing the spot purposefully. &ldquo;there?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;i fear i don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;re so insistent.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;because i now wanna know where this smith is. you made me curious. don&rsquo;t let me get another vision because of it.&rdquo; you chuckle, a dry attempt at a joke. strangely, she seemed to like it.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;well then, allow me to lead your hand, if you&rsquo;re comfortable with that?&rdquo;</p>
    <p>you looked at her and nodded, praying to whoever to not let this blush creeping up your neck make too much of a fool out of you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>with careful steps, she removed herself from the railing and stepped behind you. her hand carefully started at your forearm, snaking its way up to your hand and adjusting your angle slightly.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;here-&rdquo; she began, but you already pushed back against her a little trying to nuzzle into her like a kitten. you couldn&rsquo;t help but smile, victory feasts emerging in your head already, and fireworks of joy and whimsy going off in your stomach.</p>
    <p>after all, this was the first time you had managed to render her speechless.</p>
